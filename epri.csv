                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Electric utilities worldwide consistently report that power quality (PQ) is a fundamental component of three key utility business performance metrics: grid system performance, utility economic performance, and customer satisfaction. A resurgence of interest
 in electric power quality performance is being driven by the need to increase the economic performance of existing infrastructure, reduce the cost of grid operations and repairs, manage and respond to increasing grid complexity, and retain existing and attract
 new load with excellent PQ performance and related customer support.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>With this program, members will have access to research results that can help them in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expert analysis tools will improve methods for estimating future grid PQ harmonics, flicker, and other PQ phenomena on modern utility systems in the context of changing grid configurations and load behaviors.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Through EPRI’s lab testing, new PQ-enabled, grid-connected devices can be assessed and improved to provide actionable PQ data.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Based on EPRI laboratory testing, an updated library of end-use and distributed energy resources (DER) models could be created that would allow assessment of the PQ impact of different and changing load configurations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Benchmarking of system performance can be improved through development of updated benchmarking methods based on more robust PQ severity metrics and experience from recent and previous EPRI studies.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The development of methods such as innovative data visualization techniques, data validation techniques, and open-source data management and visualization platforms can help modern utilities get the maximum value from grid data streams.</p>
</li><li>
<p>PQ data can be integrated with other data sources to monitor the health of grid-connected equipment and, where possible, to detect incipient issues before failure or undue impact on grid performance. EPRI’s proven expertise can be leveraged in the development
 of methodologies for identifying key signature characteristics in PQ data and waveform recognition techniques to identify problems before they become catastrophes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Highly cost-effective prevention of PQ compatibility issues will be facilitated through the development of key industry standards to increase compatibility between electric power and customer loads, principally through active support of the International
 Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Council on Large Electric Systems (CIGRE), and the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards committees.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Utility PQ teams are directly supported by access to more than 900 EPRI-authored PQ technical documents and other resources via the MyPQ.epri.com website, and by expert advice on specific PQ-related problems from more than 60 EPRI PQ experts via the EPRI
 PQ Hotline. Lessons learned from support for the problems and questions raised are incorporated back into EPRI's PQ body of knowledge to be used to improve grid level power quality on a national basis. &nbsp;</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The Power Quality research program offers fundamental insights on electrical grid power quality and compatibility to improve the value of electricity service for society.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Power Quality research program places a very high priority on funder input, prioritization, and collaboration, with active funders providing guidance&nbsp;on research priorities. EPRI research in power quality will yield a variety of expertise, software,
 analysis tools, and knowledge that will be beneficial to program members. This information will be offered in several forms and is expected to include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Software tools for analysis of T&amp;D PQ phenomena and tools that enable scenario analysis of future PQ levels based on changing grid configurations, operational practices, and changing connected load and DER.</p>
</li><li>
<p>PQ data validation and visualization tools that maximize the value of data stores while reducing the cost of using and maintaining them.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Laboratory assessment of the PQ contribution and compatibility of DER, including renewables, energy storage, and smart inverters.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Laboratory and field assessment of PQ mitigation technologies and end-use device sensitivity to common PQ phenomena.</p>
</li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Power Quality program has delivered valuable research over the years that has helped its members, the industry, and society:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EPRI created the best-in-class PQ Investigator software integrating $2M in end-use device testing and facility investigation results and expertise, allowing funders to conduct expert-level facility assessments.</p>
</li><li>
<p>EPRI created the first of its kind Grid-IQ software platform for estimating future PQ performance levels based on changing loads, grid configurations, and operational practices, including an open-source-based grid model database to allow quick and low-cost
 analysis. Most prominent among these tools are the Harmonic Evaluation Module (HEM) and Flicker Evaluation Module (FEM), tools which allow analysis of current conditions and modeling of future conditions based on changes in grid configurations and end-use
 loads.</p>
</li><li>
<p>EPRI's laboratory testing of many end-use technologies has enabled the development of a detailed load model library for new and changing loads such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), light-emitting diode (LED) traffic lights, hybrid electric vehicle chargers,
 and rooftop photovoltaics (PVs).</p>
</li><li>
<p>EPRI created the PQ Dashboard, a low-cost, easy-to-deploy open source platform for visualization of PQ and other data and integration with other data resources including Geographic Information System (GIS) information.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Many of EPRI’s past research developments have been implemented over time into PQView<sup>®</sup>, a multi-component software system for building and analyzing databases of power quality and energy measurements that is jointly owned by EPRI and Electrotek
 Concepts.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The Power Quality Online Resource Center, deployed on MyPQ.epri.com, is a member-focused website featuring more than 900 EPRI-authored PQ case studies, technology briefs, and other authoritative documents available from no other source.</p>

<p>This project set focuses on PQ issues and opportunities for transmission and distribution networks. Power quality is a key electric grid performance metric and through improved understanding of PQ performance, this project set seeks to maximize the value
 of grid investments by helping to manage the inevitable consequences of increasing grid complexity. PS1A develops and supports unique tools for improving PQ management and analysis, including the Harmonics Evaluation Module and the Flicker Evaluation Module.
 Both of these tools enable unique scenario-analysis capabilities that not only help in understanding today’s PQ challenges, but also help to prevent future PQ issues through expert analysis. In addition, PS1A seeks to leverage PQ expertise by employing advance
 data analysis techniques to monitor the health and performance of grid-connected assets and to detect problems using PQ data streams before they become costly failures.</p>
<p>Among this project set’s key attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Estimates future harmonics, flicker, and other PQ phenomena using a growing library of advanced grid and load models.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Supports deployment of advanced algorithms to detect incipient grid performance issues using PQ data.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Applies to any utility that operates T&amp;D infrastructure anywhere in the world, and is especially timely for any utility actively pursuing smart-, micro-, and integrated-grid technologies.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The Key Research Questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can power quality (PQ) levels, such as harmonics, be modeled for the transmission and distribution system in the context of changing grid configurations, end-use loads, distributed energy resources, and microgrids? How can responsibility be assigned
 to different customers for harmonic distortion on a particular feeder?</p>
</li><li>
<p>What techniques can be applied to model and evaluate, and ultimately anticipate and mitigate voltage flicker, thereby enabling utilities to improve the quality of delivered electric service to customers?</p>
</li><li>
<p>What analysis tools can be developed to identify potential PQ-related performance issues or equipment failures before interruptions occur to maintain or increase reliability?</p>

<p>This project develops expert tools for detailed and efficient scenario analysis of grid harmonics and other PQ phenomena based on grid configurations, operational practices, and integration of new or changing complex loads and distributed energy resources
 (DER). The ability to allocate harmonics responsibility to different point sources is an important new feature. This project also develops and executes techniques for estimating future grid harmonics and other PQ levels through the application of grid models
 based on changing grid configurations and end-use loads.</p>
<p>Key research questions being addressed by this project include: How can power quality (PQ) levels, such as harmonics and voltage flicker be modeled for the transmission and distribution system in the context of changing grid configurations, end-use loads,
 distributed energy resources, and microgrids? How can responsibility be assigned to different customers for harmonic distortion on a particular feeder? How can a utility quickly determine present and future compliance with harmonic and voltage flicker standards

<p>This project set focuses on techniques and resources for gathering, processing, and reporting many types of data and, in particular, power quality (PQ) data. Improved acquisition, storage, analysis, and visualization of PQ data are very highly leveraged
 activities that can provide benefits greatly exceeding cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application and&nbsp;analysis of PQ and other data resources is perhaps the fastest and&nbsp;lowest-cost way to enhance value for proven grid operations and analysis.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Understanding&nbsp;new and evolving PQ data sources (such as relays, switches, and smart meters) is essential for the modern electric utility</p>
</li><li>
<p>Utilities are&nbsp;faced with a “data tsunami” that this project set is working to anticipate and manage through data integration, validation, and visualization&nbsp;tools.&nbsp;</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Key research questions for this project set are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can power quality data be quickly and efficiently integrated and visualized to inform utility decision-making to support the operation of transmission and distribution systems?</p>
</li><li>
<p>How can utilities quickly and efficiently acquire, store, and validate the accuracy and precision of PQ data? What methods can enable the most value from new and existing data management processes?</p>
</li><li>
<p>How can&nbsp;PQ data be most effectively and efficiently&nbsp;acquired and visualized so that utilities have a granular few of power quality from the entire grid?</p>

<p>This project set helps EPRI members achieve&nbsp;electrical compatibility between the power system and edge-of-grid equipment including end-use customers. Power quality mitigation solutions significantly reduce electrical disturbances at the transmission, distribution,
 and end-use levels by integrating advanced energy storage technologies with power electronics. This work comprises detailed examination and understanding of the PQ implications of distributed energy resources (DER) and microgrids, as well as other edge-of-grid
 innovations. This project set is also creating a library of end-use and DER models, which may allow assessment of the PQ impact of different and changing load configurations.</p>

<p>How can utilities understand, influence, and anticipate the sensitivity of new, changing, and emerging loads to common PQ phenomena? What will be the impact on grid PQ of new loads?</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Electricity is the only widely available and domestically produced form of energy for transportation that addresses the simultaneous needs for fuel diversity, energy security, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved air quality. The transition of
 transportation energy from petroleum to electricity represents a paradigm shift for electric utilities to the role of fuel provider for vehicles. It also represents a significant opportunity for electric utilities.</p>
<p>To help advance the use of electricity as a transportation fuel, the EPRI Electric Transportation program conducts research and development on electric vehicle and infrastructure technologies, analyzes the economic and environmental impacts of electric transportation,
 and supports industry and utility programs to build public awareness of as well as foundational work supporting electric transportation in the public interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The early market for electric vehicles (EVs) has been characterized by modest but steadily increasing sales, high vehicle reliability and customer satisfaction, and a rapid evolution of both vehicle and charging technologies. Compared to the first mass-produced
 EVs, new vehicle models can charge at faster rates and travel with greater range per charge. A variety of EV models ranging from sedans to bucket trucks are seeing increased usage in fleet applications. In addition, public charging infrastructure to support
 EVs is expanding, with the installation of thousands of public and workplace charging stations. A fast-charging network is also beginning to emerge, using direct current (DC) electricity at levels of 50 kW to 120 kW to charge EVs in as little as 20 minutes.
 In addition, automotive manufacturers have developed the first production charging systems that enable EVs to potentially interact with the grid. By the end of Mayl 2016, total U.S. EV sales exceeded 400,000 vehicles and more than 20 EV models were available
 from 11 manufacturers, including five of the six largest U.S. automotive manufacturers. Another 33 EV models are scheduled to be launched by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly all major automakers are reaching out to the utility industry to help develop and standardize EV charging infrastructure and to help educate their mutual customer. The customer, meanwhile, is also looking to the utility for guidance as an impartial
 trusted energy advisor. Residential, commercial, and industrial customers –, fleet managers, employers, retail stores, developers, local governments, and others – are seeking guidance on the design, location, and installation of charging infrastructure. Utilities
 need to understand the system impacts and customer requirements associated with plug-in vehicles, and prepare their grid to support the rollout and adoption of EVs. This program helps utilities address these challenges. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Business customers are also looking to utilities for help in quantifying the value of incorporating EVs into their vehicle fleets in both on-road and non-road operations to offset high fuel costs, improve operating efficiencies, meet environmental requirements,
 and enhance customer satisfaction. This program equips utilities to conduct such evaluations.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, the EPRI Electric Transportation program has played a leading role in the advancement of EV technologies that are at the forefront of automotive industry development efforts. EPRI also serves as a focal point of collaboration between
 the automotive and utility industries for the development of infrastructure standards, vehicle demonstration programs, and advanced infrastructure technologies. EPRI’s commercial and industrial electric transportation efforts have demonstrated the cost-effective

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Transmission companies face challenges such as improving safety and reliability, as well as reducing operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. They are also seeking ways to increase transmission capacity without making large capital investments. Reducing capital
 expenditures for new and refurbished equipment is also another priority.</p>
<p>This program is designed to address the research needs of transmission asset owners and operators. The program offers a portfolio of tools and information focused on components (e.g., conductors, insulators, compression connectors, and composite structures)
 and issues (e.g., lightning and grounding, live working, transmission capacity, and methods to assess the condition of overhead lines). The program delivers a blend of short-term tools such as software, reference guides, and field guides, together with longer-term
 research such as component-aging tests and the development of sensors for monitoring the performance of line components.</p>

<p>Utilities need to understand the condition of their overhead transmission lines to effectively manage and maintain them at their designed level of performance and safety. Inspection and assessment research is needed to understand the current condition of
 transmission assets, extend the life of those assets while keeping the aging infrastructure performance at levels that meet safety and reliability expectations of the public.</p>
<p>As assets age beyond their design margin, the ability to inspect and assess their condition becomes vital. New and emerging inspection and sensing technologies are essential to meet this challenge. As new technologies appear on the market there is a need
 for utilities to be aware of what they are, how they are applied and how they perform.</p>
<p>In addition, new inspection and maintenance management practices and tools may be based not only on the application of advanced technologies, such as robotics and sensors but also on advancements in the understanding of how line equipment and components
 age and degrade.</p>

<p>The driving questions in fleet management of transmission lines are, how do we locate areas with a high probability of failure, what is the most cost effective approach in quantifying the present condition and how do we manage that risk.</p>
<p>Atmospheric corrosion may lead to failure of conductors, shield wires, hardware, and components that result in momentary or even sustained outages. Airborne salts, acid rain, and time of wetness are the primary environmental factors controlling atmospheric
 corrosion severity. The effectiveness of protective systems, such as galvanized coatings, are strongly dependent upon the degradation rate of that coating and its time of service.</p>
<p>Utilities need to understand the present condition of their conductors, shield wires and hardware, where these severely aged components are located, what caused the degradation, how future designs may avoid premature aging and how to forecast the replacement
 schedule.</p>

<p>Predicting the remaining life of splice and dead-end compression connectors is a major challenge. Compression connector failures may increase with higher demand for heavier loading operations. Due to the limitations of existing inspection techniques, isolating
 the components early enough to avoid failure is challenging.</p>
<p>Technologies currently used to inspect compression connectors are not always reliable and repeatable, and application methods and threshold levels for these technologies are not well defined. This project intends to assess the performance of existing compression
 connection inspection technologies, develop application guidelines for inspection, and work to identify and evaluate new inspection technologies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this project intends to provide information and tools, to improve field training and connector installation, as well as making inspection, assessment and management of compression connectors easier, these tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Guidelines on proper installation of compression connectors; </li><li>&nbsp;Analysis of improved methods for inspection and assessment; </li><li>&nbsp;Tools for remediation of high risk compression connectors; </li><li>&nbsp;A population assessment approach for compression connectors; and, </li><li>&nbsp;Failure database and analysis </li></ul>

<p>The use of composite structures (including poles and cross arms) is being considered as an alternative to traditional steel and wood structures. Despite continuing refinements in material composition and manufacturing techniques, composite products have
 a fairly short history of service as crossarms and poles in electric utility service.</p>
<p>There is a need to fully understand the material attributes, as well as failure and degradation modes, particularly at high voltages. This learning is supported by identifying the initiation mechanisms leading to the degradation and failure modes of the
 material, and the aging rates of that material. The learnings enable understanding of design, application and future maintenance requirements and an estimate of the service life.</p>
<p>This project intends to address a range of concerns on composite structures including the selection and application of these structures with the objective of helping members increase their confidence in applying, inspecting and assessing these technologies.</p>

<p>Lightning is the leading cause of outages and service interruptions on transmission lines. Finding the most effective measures to improve the lighting performance of lines is not always straight forward. There are a number of options to consider, such as
 shielding, grounding, insulation, and line surge arresters to determine cost effectiveness. Some options may also impact other design aspects of the line. For example, transmission line grounding influences both the lightning performance and public/worker
 safety of transmission lines.</p>
<p>This project seeks to develop advanced engineering and maintenance tools to understand lightning and grounding performance, and evaluate effectiveness of grounds and grounding designs using traditional and new materials.</p>

<p>The continued impacts from big storm events, fueled in part by increasing variability in weather patterns due to climate change, place a clear emphasis on the need for increased resiliency in power systems. Not only do overhead lines need to be structurally
 resilient, but utilities need the ability to respond quickly and effectively, to restore damage following extreme weather events.&nbsp; Both of these needs are addressed in the following initiatives:</p>
<p>Firstly, recent overhead line failures from extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wind and ice storms have raised the question of how existing designs can be improved to provide more resilient designs that have a higher probability of surviving
 these events. The deterministic method applying safety factors to the strength of line components has been the traditional approach in designing overhead lines. The probability of failures of a line is difficult to assess using this approach, and improvements
 to the design are not effective. The probability-based design is evolving and allows for easier identification of structures and components for hardening to improve the overall reliability of an overhead transmission line.</p>
<p>Secondly, isolated overhead line failures can still occur due to exceedance of design conditions under extreme events or material degradation. Under these circumstances, an effective restoration scheme is required.&nbsp; The scheme shall include a) systems with
 appropriate materials, adaptable over a range of voltages, to allow restoration of power quickly until a permanent replacement is available, b) a well-defined, coordinated strategy to effectively integrate disciplines participating in the restoration effort
 and c) ongoing emergency preparedness training to increase restoration speed and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Currently, millions of porcelain and glass insulators are approaching or have exceeded the end of their intended service life. With increasing age utilities are seeking end of life metrics in order to prioritize maintenance and replacement programs. Utilities
 need industry wide information about the performance of insulators and how to identify them so they can effectively perform the maintenance.</p>
<p>In addition to age related degradation, recent shifts in manufacturing locations, market expansion, and new emerging manufacturing plants have introduced uncertainties in the performance of new porcelain and glass insulators. These changes have introduced
 a need to evaluate traditional tests and develop new tests to ensure the insulators perform as expected.</p>

<p>The demand for electric power over transmission circuits is increasing at a faster rate than transmission assets were originally built for. This trend is pushing the capacity of many existing transmission circuits to their design limits. Additionally, much
 of the grid has already aged beyond its original design specifications. These issues are affecting the grid causing an increasing number of bottlenecks, and other congestion and reliability problems.</p>

<p>Transmission asset owners may increase the power transfer capacity of its transmission lines by increasing the current flow in a transmission which raises the conductor operating temperature. The effects of an elevated conductor temperature may result in
 reduced conductor ground clearance, loss of conductor strength, and damage to connectors and other overhead line components. In addition to these mechanical effects the elevated temperatures may impact the line corona performance. Inaccurate corona and thermal

<p>Recently developed high-temperature conductors (also known as advanced conductors, high-temperature low-sag conductors, or simply HTLS conductors) offer the advantages of higher current capacity, lower conductor sag, and lower line losses than conventional
 ACSR (aluminum conductor steel-reinforced) conductors. Knowledge on the long-term performance of HTLS conductors is limited, particularly for newly developed products. In addition, there is a need for information on the selection, procurement, application
 and maintenance of HTLS conductors.&nbsp; This project intends to address a range of concerns and give transmission owners and operator confidence in applying this technology.&nbsp; This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determining the applicability of conventional conductor maintenance tools and procedures for HTLS application</p>
</li><li>
<p>Documenting utility design and installation experience</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developing test protocols that may be applied to predict the long term performance advanced conductors.</p>

<p>Aging equipment fleets, more stringent operating requirements, financial constraints and retiring expertise make managing transmission line assets challenging. Many electric utilities are considering or already have moved toward implementing asset management
 concepts and decision-making procedures based on minimizing equipment life-cycle costs and risks. However, the data, analytical tools and models required for power delivery equipment risk assessment and management are not well established.</p>
<p>This project intends to support utilities in their asset management decision making through its complete life cycle including acquisition, operation, inspection, maintenance and disposal. Asset management analytics supports intelligent fleet management to
 improve performance, control costs, extend overhead transmission line asset life and maintain reliability.</p>
<p>Fleet management decision support analytics and methodologies require new knowledge, tools and methodologies to accomplish these steps and help with the implementation of a successful risk based equipment asset management program. Required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data models and database structures to assemble historical and future line performance data</p>
</li><li>
<p>Methodologies and tools for analyzing and extracting information from industry-wide databases</p>
</li><li>
<p>Metrics to better quantify equipment performance</p>
</li><li>
<p>Condition assessment approaches and tools</p>
</li><li>
<p>Analytics for projecting future performance</p>
</li><li>
<p>A generic framework for incorporating condition indices, operational requirements, and business rules into a risk-based assessment and mitigation methodology</p>
</li><li>
<p>Transmission line asset management guidelines</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Key research areas are categorized in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asset Characterization and Performance Information</p>
</li><li>
<p>Asset Health Algorithms</p>
</li><li>
<p>Asset Management Program Decision Support</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technology Transfer</p>
</li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Underground transmission systems consist of extruded and laminar dielectric cables and accessories. While a significant portion of the installed cable base is laminar dielectric cables, the trend has shifted towards installing more cables using extruded
 dielectric technologies.</p>
<p>The research results of the EPRI Underground Transmission Program support utilities to resolve challenges in design, construction, installation, operations, and maintenance of both extruded and laminar dielectric cable systems. Cross-cutting research addresses
 issues such as design calculations, static and dynamic cable ratings, and inspection technologies. Research specific to extruded dielectric cables focuses on cable thermo-mechanical performance and advanced sensing and monitoring. Research specific to laminar
 dielectric cables focuses on cable and system diagnostics and buried steel pipe corrosion. One project is designed to focus on technology transfer and knowledge capture for transmission cable engineers of utilities installing or considering underground transmission
 lines. The project includes EPRI Green Book update, Increased Power Flow Guide Book update, industry engagement, and member technical supports in various formats. The project on Cable Systems Asset Management Analytics is to address issues in implementing
 asset management concepts and decision-making procedures.</p>

<p>Laminar dielectric cable systems consist of high-pressure fluid-filled (HPFF), high-pressure gas-filled (HPGF), and self-contained fluid-filled (SCFF) cable systems. About 80% of the installed underground transmission infrastructure in North America is laminar
 dielectric cables. These cables in general have provided long lasting service to the utilities, surpassing their design life specifications. However, the growing age of many of these assets may be a cause for concern. Replacement costs for laminar dielectric
 cable systems are high. The consequences of electrical failures or cable system fluid leaks are significant. Research is needed to</p>

<p>This project develops new tools and knowledge to help substation owners anticipate and prevent failures in transformers, extend transformer life, develop and retain key subject matter expertise and specify new diagnostic equipment with confidence. With the
 increasing need for maximizing the use of their assets while maintaining highest levels of system reliability, management of the aging power transformers has become a critical issues facing today's substation owners. This project addresses key issues that
 are central to transformer management and include effective transformer diagnostics, condition and aging assessments, knowledge retention and transfer, and life extension. The activities are laid out in a multi-year research plan to close the existing research
 gaps.</p>

<p>The life cycle performance of a circuit breaker is determined by the performance and condition of its materials and components. Together, they drive the requirements for maintenance and refurbishment or replacement. There is very little quantifiable data
 on breaker material and sub-system performance available to make well-informed conclusions and design cost-effective condition-based maintenance programs. To bridge these gaps, proposed research may develop the information, and develop tools, techniques and
 methodologies, for high voltage circuit breaker life management. The methods developed may be adapted so that they can be applied to medium voltage (13.8 kV to 69 kV) breakers.</p>
<p>Through a multi-year research effort, it is anticipated that the development may result in:</p>
<p>• Maintenance guidelines</p>
<p>• Innovative techniques for condition-based maintenance</p>
<p>• Equipment aging assessment tools - failure modes, degradation mechanisms and diagnostics</p>
<p>• Diagnostic effectiveness assessments</p>
<p>• Reference books, guidelines, videos, field guides and technology transfer workshops</p>

<p>A substation ground grid is an essential component of the substation and must provide the following functions to preserve system integrity and eliminate risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide step and touch potential protection for any personnel who may be in the substation
</li><li>Minimize hazards to the public, such as step and touch potentials near or around the perimeter of the substation
</li><li>Provide adequate grounding for substation equipment and control room electronics by minimizing ground potential rises in the substation during faults, lightning strikes and normal/abnormal switching operations.
</li></ul>
<p>Substation ground grids must be designed to ensure that even the most severe faults and transient voltage rises will not harm staff or damage equipment within the substation and will not create hazards for the public outside the substation fence. Faults
 or transient voltage rises in substations may result in electrical stresses on the ground grid system and other substation equipment, and may be categorized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stresses during power system faults or lightning strikes </li><li>Stresses during switching operations </li><li>Stresses that are the expansive and persistent forces of corrosion and weather.
</li><li>Stresses due to freezing and soil expansion may break the connection of individual elements.
</li><li>Soil corrosion, which is worse for low resistivity soil, constantly degrades the grounding electrodes and conductors. Galvanic corrosion resulting from dissimilar metals may accelerate this process.
</li></ul>
<p>This corrosion may cause the failure of individual grounding elements or the deterioration of the entire grounding system.&nbsp; It may cause an interruption in the grounding system continuity, introducing high resistances across bonds, inadequate step and touch
 potential protection and ground potential rises that can damage equipment.</p>
<p>Required are –</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inspection and assessment approaches to locate and assess ground grid corrosion</p>
</li><li>
<p>Guidance on corrosion rates</p>
</li><li>
<p>Guidance on how to mitigate underlying degradation</p>

<p>Air break disconnect switches are critical assets for utilities and are key to the operability of a substation. The age of disconnect switches and the fact that they may be operated infrequently, coupled with cost reduction strategies have brought to the
 forefront the need to minimize maintenance expenditures. Organizational goals of minimum maintenance, high reliability, and extended life cycle can cause conflicting results. The maintenance of high voltage disconnect and grounding switches has characteristically
 been based on in-service time and number of operations. This approach works well during the early life of the switch, but current concerns which include aging equipment, limited maintenance resources, the requirement for increased emergency ratings, restricted
 maintenance outages, and the demand for high reliability have maintenance and asset managers exploring maintenance improvements and alternative replacement strategies. EPRI R&amp;D is helping utilities reduce maintenance costs and uncertainties, and maximize disconnect
 switch reliability through the application of new technology, and improved disconnect switch life-cycle management through the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of the most problematic disconnect and grounding switch designs
</li><li>The exploration and testing of minimal disassembly refurbishment methods for disconnect switches
</li><li>Investigation of a next generation of disconnect switch including drop in replacement disconnect switch designs
</li><li>Simplified disconnect live part replacements </li><li>Simplified operating mechanisms and linkages </li><li>Examination of disconnect switch application and ratings </li></ul>
<p>Additionally, the power industry recognizes that there is a need to identify and develop methods and tools for increasing and optimizing the power throughput of existing assets in a scientifically rigorous manner including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective tools for performing rating calculations and studies </li><li>Improved thermal models for transmission substation components </li><li>Improved rating processes and best practices information </li><li>Effective technology transfer </li></ul>

<p>GIS (Gas Insulated Substations) and GIL (Gas Insulated Lines) offer many benefits including physical security, compact size, modularity and protection from harsh environments. They also present challenges including higher initial costs, maintenance issues,
 and potential leakage of SF6 (a powerful greenhouse gas). EPRI R&amp;D is helping utilities reduce maintenance costs and uncertainties, minimize SF6 emissions and improve GIS and GIL life-cycle management through the following:</p>
<p>• Researching and demonstrating effective methods for on-line diagnostics of GIS and GIL</p>
<p>• Researching the performance of SF6 replacements – starting first in GIL and GIS bus since there is no arc interruption.&nbsp; Once this step is successful further research will extend to GIS chambers that experience arcing (breakers, disconnectors, grounding
 switches).</p>
<p>• Reducing SF6 emissions through research into both SF6 capture techniques and SF6 leak sealing.&nbsp; Results from both laboratory and field trials will be presented.</p>

<p>Aging equipment fleets, more stringent operating requirements, financial constraints and retiring expertise make managing substation assets difficult. Many electric utilities are considering or already have moved toward implementing asset management concepts
 and decision-making procedures based on minimizing equipment life-cycle costs and risks. However, the data, analytical tools and models required for power delivery equipment risk assessment and management are not well established. Best practice asset management
 decisions for maximizing performance and minimizing equipment life-cycle costs should be based upon risks associated with actual equipment condition and historical performance. There are four key steps involved: understanding existing performance, understanding
 required performance, projecting future performance, and understanding how to bridge gaps.</p>
<p>Fleet management decision support analytics and methodologies require new knowledge, tools and methodologies to accomplish these steps and help with the implementation of a successful risk based equipment asset management program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data models and database structures to assemble historical and future equipment performance data
</li><li>Methodologies and tools for analyzing and extracting information from industry-wide databases
</li><li>Metrics to better quantify equipment performance </li><li>Condition assessment approaches and tools </li><li>Analytics for projecting future performance </li><li>A generic framework for incorporating condition indices, operational requirements, and business rules into a risk-based assessment and mitigation methodology

<p>This project will help utilities reduce costs and improve reliability and availability by decreasing the potential for bushing failures. The performance of a utility’s power transformers depends on the condition of the transformer components and sub-system.
 Bushings are a key component however numerous recent transformer failures have been attributed to possible bushing issues. Consequently, the utility industry is concerned about the performance of bushings in their transformer fleets. The objective of the proposed
 research is to better understand bushing problems, magnitude, operating stresses, underlying failure modes and degradation rates and provide utilities with guidelines for selection, application, procurement, maintenance and testing to insure satisfactory bushing
 performance. Required are:</p>
<p>• A better understanding of bushing failure root causes</p>
<p>• More effective bushing diagnostic techniques</p>
<p>• Reference books, guidelines and technology transfer workshops</p>
<p>• Collaborative environments for sharing lessons learned and best practices</p>

<p>A 2013 act of vandalism that damaged several high-voltage transformers in a west coast substation and other post 9/11 events have focused the electric power industry’s attention on the need for enhanced physical security against attacks at substations and
 transmission facilities. Additionally, various agencies, such as the EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) Commission in its 2008 report, are recommending that the threat and potential consequences of electromagnetic attack be addressed.&nbsp; Compromises to the security
 of the power system could cause long-term outages, which can adversely impact the economy, the environment, public safety, and national security. Such compromises could cost utilities, and ultimately society, billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State lists over 42 international terrorist groups operating around the world today. Approximately 2500 attacks have been conducted by such groups against transmission lines and towers in various parts of the world in the ten-year
 period from 1996-2006. The next most frequently attacked power transmission target for international terrorists has been substations, with more than 500 attacks over the same period. The objectives of this project are to address physical security threats and
 Intentional Electromagnetic Interference (IEMI) threats in alignment with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) physical security standards adopted in 2015, and proposed standards in IEMI. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The reliability of many transmission substations is impacted by flashovers due to insulator contamination when exposed to sources such as road salt, marine salts and industrial pollution. These environmental challenges can be accounted for in the initial
 design, but there is also a need to remediate existing substation assets which underperform due to contamination flashovers. This leads to the following research questions:</p>
<p>• What is the optimum design for new external insulation at contaminated substations?</p>
<p>• How to best address existing contaminated substations that have unacceptable flashover performance?</p>
<p>• What is the technical basis for implementing, or timing maintenance actions to address contamination outages?</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>In many ways, today's power system must be operated to meet objectives for which it was not explicitly designed. The transmission system is operated to transfer larger amounts of energy over greater distances utilizing an increasingly higher percentage of
 non-traditional resources than were considered when it was built. Generation resources are more constrained and increasingly more variable and uncertain. Demand resources are now increasingly used for resource adequacy and providing ancillary services in many
 regions. All of these changes are occurring at a rate that is outpacing corresponding growth in transmission infrastructure. As a result, new methods and tools will be required to operate tomorrow’s grid reliably and efficiently.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is imperative that operators be provided with actionable information based on real-time data regarding the status of the system, as well as decision-making support to respond to rapid changes that might occur in the near future.
 New sources of real-time data from synchrophasor measurements and forecasts of future load and variable renewable output levels, along with improved visibility of alarms and protection system implications, enable the possibility of providing operators with
 increased situational awareness and advanced decision-support tools. System operators need such tools to continue to reliably and economically operate the system in the face of emerging challenges.</p>
<p>EPRI’s Grid Operations research program is addressing these needs by improving real-time situational awareness, developing tools that use synchrophasor and other measurements to assess the present system operating point relative to thermal, transient, and
 voltage stability operating limits, evaluating methods for more intelligently managing alarms, and developing tools to manage the grid through extreme events and restore the system in the event of an outage.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The mission of EPRI's Grid Operations research program is to support the development of next-generation situational awareness, analysis, and control capabilities that will be required to operate the transmission grid in the most reliable and economic manner
 as the grid continues to evolve at an unprecedented rate. In 2017, this will be accomplished through a collaborative process in which EPRI works with its utility and independent system operator (ISO) members and other stakeholders to identify existing research
 gaps and associated project needs that would provide value to EPRI members. Once identified, the EPRI Grid Operations team of technical and project management experts work with members and the world’s foremost experts in related research areas to structure
 and conduct specific projects that provide value in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term. Finally, this value is transferred to members through collaborative advisory and task force interactions, workshops and webcasts, and specific applications and demonstrations
 of the developed methods and tools.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI's Grid Operations research program delivers value using the shared experiences and understanding of its utility and ISO members in conjunction with the expertise of EPRI's staff and network of worldwide contractors. The program conducts research projects
 that lead to prototype methods and tools that are applied and validated by system operators before being transferred to commercial vendors that supply and support member applications. EPRI also engages with external industry standards, regulatory, and research
 efforts to ensure that the EPRI research program is taking advantage of broader industry efforts and advancing the state of the art.</p>
<p>This research program also strives to provide near-term, mid-term, and long-term value from each research project each year. For example, in 2016 the System Voltage and Reactive Power Management project (39.012) will deliver: (1) an updated version of a
 reference guide on Industry Practices and Tools for Voltage/VAR Planning and Management that can be used immediately to inform member planning and operating practices and to educate new staff in this area; (2) a new prototype software tool to determine improved
 load models for real-time power flow studies from synchrophasor measurements that can be evaluated by members for further refinement; and (3) preliminary research results to develop an improved method to calculate the voltage collapse point for stability analysis
 that can be implemented in new assessment tools in the future.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI's Grid Operations program has provided critically needed technologies and information for its members over many years. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Flow Optimization Version (PFOpt) 1.0 (3002005857): </strong>The PFOPT package implements robust AC (nonlinear) power flow algorithms that are more robust to bad initial points and stressed (near singular Jacobians) cases as compared to the
 traditional AC power flow technique, the Newton-Raphson method. The new algorithms can be used to test difficult to solve cases from non-convergent state estimator cases or from challenging planning power flows cases.&nbsp; While the goal of the research is to
 engage commercial tool vendors to incorporate the new algorithms, the PFOpt tool can be used for evaluating existing cases and provide insights for adjusting the cases to allow them to converge.
</li><li><strong>24 Hour Day-Ahead Reactive Power Forecasting and Optimal Scheduling (3002002171) and Short-Term Reactive Power Forecasting and Scheduling (STRPFS) Version 1.0 (3002002842):&nbsp;</strong>This report describes algorithms and an associated prototype software
 tool to forecast day-ahead reactive power needs at a substation level and optimally schedule reactive power resources to meet those needs. The methods and tools developed as part of this project optimize the power system to produce a security-constrained case,
 reduce losses, increase reactive reserve, and securely maintain voltage stability. The control variables available to the operators include generator bus voltages, transformer voltage/phase angle tap set points, and switched shunt statuses.
</li><li><strong>System Restoration Tools: System Restoration Navigator Integrated into EPRI Operator Training Simulator (SRN/OTS) and Optimal Blackstart Capability (OBC) (3002002840):&nbsp;</strong>This report describes new algorithms for developing system restoration
 plans and supporting operator decision support as to the next step during an actual restoration event. Supporting research and case study results were provided for the OBC research in technical report #1024262 and for the SRN in technical report #1020055.
 The associated algorithms are incorporated into the following prototype tool sets:
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal Blackstart Capability (OBC) Tool 1.0 (1025089):</strong>&nbsp;This software tool was delivered in 2012 and incorporates a new algorithm to identify the optimal location and size of blackstart units with the objective function of maximizing total
 generation output within a given restoration time frame. An updated version of this tool incorporating needed changes identified during initial applications of the prototype tool is being developed and expected to be delivered in 2015.
</li><li><strong>System Restoration Navigator (SRN) Version 2.0 (1021715):</strong>&nbsp;This software tool, delivered in 2011, incorporates algorithms to determine successive restoration actions to optimally achieve specified restoration objectives at identified priority
 levels. This stand-alone version of the tool can be utilized in developing restoration plans and protocols. An updated version of this tool is also being developed and expected to be delivered in 2015
</li><li><strong>System Restoration Navigator (SRN) Integrated with EPRI Operator Training Simulator (OTS) Version 1.0 (3002002807):</strong>&nbsp;The stand-alone version of the SRN was integrated into the EPRI OTS for demonstrating and evaluating real-time application
 of the SRN algorithms to support an operator’s next decision during a restoration event. The integrated SRN was developed as a stand-alone component with an API that provides the capability for the EPRI OTS, or any other commercial dispatch training simulator,
 to interact with the SRN to obtain guidance for the operator on subsequent restoration outages.
</li><li><strong>Reactive Power Management to Address Long-Term Voltage Stability Using Voltage Control Area (VCA) Technique (1024258):</strong>&nbsp;This software tool investigates voltage security problems and identifies the voltage control areas to address steady-state
 stability problems and effective deployment and utilization of reactive power resources.
</li><li><strong>Online Measurement-Based Voltage Stability Assessment Tool (MBVSA) Version 2.0 (1024990):&nbsp;</strong>The MBVSA software calculates voltage stability indices at the substation and load center levels for a power transmission system using measurement
 data at key substations. The tool can be used offline to analyze historical data or integrated into the control room of a transmission system if fed with online measurement data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) or the Entergy Management System (EMS).

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>In 2017, EPRI's Grid Operations research program will offer its members a focused research portfolio with the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve system reliability and reduce operational risks through the improved situational awareness of operators, including incorporating equipment health and protection system information into the control center, streamlining alarm management methods through
 identification of root causes and grouping of alarms, and identifying multiple operating boundaries and margins into aggregated visualizations.
</li><li>Support operators in identifying potential voltage stability concerns in real time by more accurately modeling the voltage sensitivity of loads and more accurately determining the actual voltage collapse point when evaluating transfers across an interface.
 The project will also accomplish this task by providing a (1) reference guide to ensure that steady-state and post-contingency system voltage performance is maintained &nbsp;and (2) a new method/tool for identifying voltage control areas across which the optimal
 mix of available reactive resources can be identified. </li><li>Improve restoration time and reduce outage costs through identifying optimal blackstart capability requirements and developing restoration decision-support applications that take into account the impacts of emerging resources such as HVDC and renewables.
</li><li>Support operator situational awareness and decision making by developing advanced analysis algorithms that use emerging hardware and software-enabled approaches to increase computational efficiency and improve the performance of control room applications,
 and increase the resolution of calculations to take advantage of new inputs such as synchrophasor data.
</li><li>Investigate tools and techniques that validate and correct synchrophasor data which can then be used to assess power system stability and predict unstable system behavior in a forecasted time window and to develop associated control methods to mitigate
 potential stability issues. </li></ul>

<p>Ensuring that the power system is resilient to outages due to terrestrial and solar weather, cyber-attacks, malicious actors and other events has received increased attention in recent years. Federal and state governments are working jointly with the power
 industry to address resiliency by focusing on approaches such as hardening of assets and availability of spare equipment. Additional efforts are needed to make prudent planning decisions as to grid investments and provide operators support in making decisions
 during resiliency events. Similarly, planners and operators need improved tools to expedite system restoration following major outages or blackouts.&nbsp; EPRI's research in this area is focused on:</p>
<ol>
<li>New methods and tools for developing restoration plans as the resource mix changes.
</li><li>Visualization and decision support tools for managing restoration and resiliency events by real-time operations.

<p>Control center operation is becoming more complex as new reliability, economics, and public policy issues emerge.&nbsp; Computer simulations and system measurement data are used to analyze present system status and what-if-scenarios to derive succinct information
 for operators to make better informed decisions.&nbsp; The complexities of the system models upon which these decisions are made are increasing with high penetrations of distributed resources pushing the need to include distribution level details into grid models.&nbsp;
 Additionally, the availability of new sources of data, such as synchrophasor data at much higher resolutions than traditional control room data provides the basis for conducting analyses on much higher time resolutions than in the past.&nbsp; The purpose of this
 project is to explore leveraging advancements in data processing, computing technologies and numerical methods to enable efficient processing, simulation and analysis of more complex system models and higher time resolutions to provide timelier, more complete,
 and more accurate information to operators and engineers.</p>

<p>Along with the increasing deployment in the power system grids of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and other devices that provide high-resolution, synchronized measurements, numerous synchrophasor-based applications have been and continue to be developed,
 both for offline and online environment that target to enhance grid operations and planning and are expected to contribute to the improvement of grid reliability and security.</p>
<p>One of the applications that has attracted the interest of the industry is utilizing synchronized measurements for real-time oscillations control. In today’s interconnected power grids, small signal stability and low-frequency oscillations are a significant
 issue limiting the power transfer capability and even deteriorating power system security. Typically local controllers (such as generator power system stabilizers) have been used to suppress these low-frequency oscillations, and they are conventionally designed
 and tuned based on the system circuit model around a particular operating point and for hypothetical critical contingency scenarios. Synchronized measurements enable the development and design of wide-area and adaptive controllers that adapt to the grid changing
 conditions, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional controllers, resulting in improved oscillations damping control.</p>
<p>Although it is widely recognized that synchrophasor-based applications could significantly improve power system operations, there are several challenges that remain to be solved to achieve high levels of accuracy and robustness of the applications, especially
 if they are targeted to be implemented in a real-time production environment. One of the challenges is the data quality of the streaming data and their impact on the robustness of the applications. There are several drivers of bad synchrophasor data, such
 as PMU hardware failure, poor communications network performance, etc. A data conditioning tool that will continuously monitor the quality of the streaming data and accurately differentiate bad data from abnormal measurement values due to a system contingency
 is necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another factor that can increase the robustness of synchrophasor applications is accurate offline testing. Typically the offline design and testing of synchrophasor based applications is performed using unfiltered and clean simulation data, without taking
 into account the PMUs filtering effect. The same typically holds when performing offline component and/or system model validation using recorded measurement data. It is important to analyze and consider the filtering effects of PMUs when comparing between
 actual synchrophasors provided by PMUs and simulation results generated by electromechanical dynamics simulation tools.</p>

<p>Situational awareness is critical for grid operators to maintain system reliability and minimize major power outages. At present, the combination of rapid growth of regional electricity markets, increasing integration of variable generation resources, and
 lack of corresponding growth in transmission infrastructure is introducing more data and more uncertainties into daily grid operations. These changes could result in the transmission system operating closer to its limits and could increase the likelihood of
 stability issues during disturbances or equipment failures.</p>
<p>This project aims to develop new methods and tools to improve operators' situational awareness of the operating limits relative to the current operating point and associated operating decision support. In 2017, the R&amp;D efforts will focus on the following
 research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing Critical Operating Boundaries: </strong>What definition of critical operating boundaries is most appropriate to operators in different situations?&nbsp; Can the identification of critical operating boundaries be conducted automatically and
 dynamically for diverse operating conditions? How can we identify operator actions that can mitigate or avoid system violations?
</li><li><strong>Visualization of Operating Boundaries: </strong>How can we identify and visualize dynamically the most critical operating information, while still allowing the operator to drill efficiently into multiple layers of analytical data? How can we visualize
 effective operator actions? </li></ul>

<p>Situational awareness is critical for grid operators to maintain reliability and minimize major system disruptions. Although there is an increasing availability of sensor data related to power system equipment health, system operators generally have little
 visibility of information or decision support that can be derived from this data. Information as to the condition of critical equipment and protection systems in the power system can help operators recognize potential increased risks associated with changes
 to the state of the system.</p>
<p>Managing alarms associated with equipment conditions and system changes has become increasingly important in recent years.&nbsp; An EPRI survey found that the volume and complexity of the alarms received in control centers are increasing.&nbsp; Operators need better
 processes and tools to derive and prioritize actionable information from alarms and to better visualize the potential implications of alarms.</p>
<p>Additionally, other sources of information are becoming available within the control room. This project looks at how these new sources, along with new techniques for traditional information, can be combined to improve the overall operator awareness of the
 system.</p>

<p>Per the IEEE/CIGRE Joint Task Force on Stability Terms and Definitions, <em>voltage stability</em> refers to the ability of a power system to maintain steady voltages at all buses in the system after being subjected to a disturbance from a given initial
 operating condition.&nbsp; Whether steady voltages can be maintained following a disturbance depends upon the balance between reactive power demand and resources.&nbsp; A disturbance may upset the balance such that the available reactive power resources may not meet
 the demand.&nbsp; The resulting reactive power shortage can be due to factors such as high reactive power demand associated with power flows and associated reactive power losses across highly inductive transmission lines, tripping of area generators due to over-excitation
 condition, etc.&nbsp; Excessive shortage can result in progressively lower voltages across an area of a power system.&nbsp; This voltage instability phenomenon can cause loss of load as well as cascading outages involving area transmission lines and generators.&nbsp; If
 this leads to a blackout or abnormally low voltages in a significant portion of a power system, it is termed as voltage collapse.</p>
<p>Voltage stability is a major concern in system operations and a leading factor that limits power transfers. The changing generation mix and the changing dynamic characteristics of loads bring more challenges to maintain voltage stability in the operating
 environment.&nbsp; Identifying potential voltage instability areas and determining the required reactive power requirements in real time are technical challenges that need to be solved. There are also increasing research needs regarding techniques for optimally
 managing dynamic reactive resources to ensure fast voltage recovery, as well as techniques for sensing voltage recovery following disturbances.&nbsp; The long term goal of project P39.012 (Voltage and Reactive Power Management) is to develop improved tools and
 techniques for real-time voltage stability assessment and reactive power management.</p>

<p>Voltage and Reactive Power (VAR) Planning and Management (VVPM) refers to maintaining satisfactory voltage performance across the power system of interest. Excessively low or high voltages have negative impact on power system stability performance and equipment.&nbsp;
 Maintaining voltages to within satisfactory range requires proper planning and managing reactive power resources of the system.&nbsp; Reactive power deficiency can lead to voltage instability or voltage collapse, while excessive reactive power can lead to high
 voltages that can damage equipment.&nbsp; Therefore, transmission planners and operators work closely to identify reactive power resource requirements and means to control voltages.&nbsp; VVPM plays an extremely critical role in maintaining power system reliability,
 as evident from many of the wide-area blackouts that have occurred in recent decades due to insufficient reactive power resources.&nbsp; Also, there are increasing cases where voltage-constrained flowgates force operators to curtail transactions across these interfaces
 due to VVPM problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reliability Coordinators and Transmission Operators perform power flow studies in real-time operations environment to identify potential operating scenarios (e.g. power transfers, generation dispatch, contingencies, etc.) that could jeopardize the bulk power
 system’s Operating Reliability.&nbsp; These power flow studies typically assume constant P/constant Q load modeling to represent the loads connected at transmission substation levels.&nbsp; The constant P/constant Q load model does not capture the sensitivity of load
 to voltage, especially a portion of load that may be directly proportional to the voltage.&nbsp; Therefore, this model is considered to be conservative for power flow study scenarios (e.g. increased power transfers, contingencies, etc.) that result in reduced system
 voltages.&nbsp; The use of such conservative load model can result in undue operating restrictions such as power transfer across a voltage stability constrained interface.</p>
<p>To capture load sensitivity to voltage, these power flow studies can employ the ZIP --- constant impedance/constant current/constant power --- load model.&nbsp; It has been observed that use of ZIP load model to represent the load within a voltage stability constrained
 interface can support increased power transfer across the interface.&nbsp; However, a reasonably accurate ZIP load model for such locations is necessary so that Operating Reliability is not compromised.&nbsp; If synchrophasor data are available at such locations, it
 is possible to investigate load sensitivity to voltage, which can be utilized to develop the corresponding ZIP model.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Traditional power system planning methods and tools are increasingly challenged in today’s power system environment. Transmission owners and operators not only need to plan for future demand growth and increasingly uncertain generation portfolios, but also
 to provide transmission services based on distributed resources and central generation resources that include significant portions of variable generation (VG) technologies that are often remote from load centers and have significantly different dynamic behavior
 from synchronous generation. The challenge of meeting reliability requirements with the changing landscape and increasing levels of uncertainty may necessitate adjusting and augmenting transmission planning criteria and methods.</p>
<p>Transmission planners are also increasingly tasked with considering deeper and varied contingencies requiring screening of many more potential contingencies and prioritizing the contingencies for more detailed analysis. They also need to plan the system
 to withstand “special” circumstances such as the impacts of geomagnetic disturbances, electromagnetic pulses, and various physical security attacks on system reliability, and non-traditional impacts such as high levels of harmonic distortion. Some of these
 more advanced contingency analyses also require consideration of breaker-node representation and closer coordination and explicit integration of protection system models in planning models.</p>
<p>Resource planners are also increasingly challenged as environmental regulation forces the retirement of some conventional generation, as supply resources become more variable and uncertain, and as distributed and demand-side resources become more viable.
 Additionally, demand response and extreme temperatures in traditionally shoulder load periods are increasing the uncertainty in load levels at specific points in time. As a result, resource adequacy planning methods may require more consideration of the operational
 uncertainties associated with renewable energy and load forecast errors.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The mission of EPRI's Grid Planning research program is to support the development and validation of planning study models, planning processes and frameworks, and reliability assessment analytics that will be required to build a reliable and economic transmission
 grid that integrates an evolving generation mix to supply an increasingly complex load that can also act as a system resource. The Grid Planning program directly supports EPRI’s Research Imperative #3 “Integrated Power System and Environmental Modeling Framework.”
 This is accomplished through a collaborative process in which EPRI works with utility and independent system operator (ISO) members and other stakeholders to identify existing research gaps and associated project needs that would provide value to society and
 EPRI members. Once identified, the EPRI Grid Planning team of technical and project management experts works with members and the world’s foremost experts in related research areas to structure and conduct specific projects that create value by delivering
 a combination of research results that provide value in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term. Finally, this value is transferred to members through collaborative advisory and task force interactions, workshops and webcasts, and specific applications and
 demonstrations of the developed methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI's Grid Planning research program delivers value by using the shared experiences and understanding of its utility and ISO members, in conjunction with the expertise of EPRI's staff and network of worldwide contractors. The program conducts research projects
 that lead to innovative methods and tools used by system planners. EPRI's Grid Planning program also engages with external industry standards groups, regulatory agencies, and other research efforts to ensure that the EPRI research program is building upon
 and leveraging broader stakeholder efforts and advancing the state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>For research areas where the developed deliverables are of value to EPRI members only if embraced by the larger stakeholder community, for example as with the development of new models that need to be adopted in commercial analysis packages, EPRI works to
 engage in industry efforts and share research publicly to drive society and all stakeholders to the desired path. The EPRI research program also strives to provide near-term, mid-term, and long-term value from each research project. For example, the 2016 the
 Grid Planning research program will deliver new prototype tools for generating and screening new contingency types and guidelines for conducting GMD studies, while also investigating methods and tool through which risk-based analysis methods can be integrated
 with existing planning processes to address the increasing levels and sources of uncertainty that will increasingly impact system planning in the future.</p>
<p>The research in the Grid Planning program addresses five primary areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Model Development, Validation, and Management </li><li>System Protection Methods &amp; Tools for Planning </li><li>Risk-Based System Planning </li><li>Special Planning Study Methods and Tools </li><li>Advanced Power Flow and Contingency Analysis Methods and Tools </li></ol>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Grid Planning program delivers valuable information that helps its members, other electric power stakeholders, and society in numerous ways. Some examples include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>System-Wide Protection Evaluation Macro Tool (3002006864):</em> </strong>
This deliverable provides a macro that integrates into a commercial short circuit analysis software tool to allow the user to configure aspects of a system-wide short circuit study and then execute the simulations and report on the results. Based on the configuration
 from the user, the macro identifies protection systems which may mis-operate allowing the user to identify potentially incorrect relay settings prior to mis-operation occurring.
</li><li><strong><em>Categorizing Line TOV Values for Determining Minimum Approach Distances (3002004444):&nbsp;
</em></strong>This report documents a technical basis for characterizing transient overvoltage values (TOV) that drive the minimum approach distances for conducting live-line work. The report summarizes the maximum TOV magnitudes expected for various line characteristics
 and associated operational practices. </li><li><strong><em>Power Plant Parameter Derivation (PPPD) Version 5.0 (1025786):&nbsp; </em>
</strong>The PPPD software uses measured synchronous generator responses to system disturbances to validate the generator, excitation system, and governor control system transient stability models. This tool allows transmission generation owners to perform
 ongoing model validation as system disturbances occur to support system reliability and to comply with emerging North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) requirements to periodically validate the generator models.
</li><li><strong><em>Enhancing and Testing Fast Fault Screening (FFS) Methodology (1024271) and Fast Fault Screening for Transient Stability Studies (1021928):&nbsp;</em>
</strong>These technical updates present methodologies developed in the Grid Planning program for fast prediction of the most severe three-phase fault locations for transient and voltage stability studies and then ranks them in order of severity to support
 reliability and more efficient compliance with NERC TPL standards. </li><li><strong><em>Comprehensive Load Modeling for System Planning Studies (1015999):&nbsp;</em>
</strong>This technical report covers both measurement-based and component-based load modeling. It also contains a guide to comprehensive load modeling for planning studies and detailed laboratory test results of select load components, such as air conditioners,
 compact fluorescent lighting, and high-definition televisions. It also includes the results and insights of measurement-based load model parameter derivation modeling research.
</li><li><strong><em>Transmission Contingency and Reliability Evaluation (TransCARE) (1022353):&nbsp;
</em></strong>This software provides a comprehensive framework for computing reliability indices for transmission networks, identifying worst-case contingencies and impacts of remedial action schemes, analyzing costs and benefits for various transmission upgrade
 options, studying the impacts of variable generation on system reliability, and analyzing extreme events, as well as performing NERC compliance studies.

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>In 2017, EPRI's Grid Planning research program will focus research on the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop and validate static and dynamic models of system components such as HVDC and loads, including completion of the VSC HVDC dynamic models that can be used in system planning studies. Additionally, methods for system-wide model validation based on
 measurements will be applied, evaluated, and revised. </li><li>Develop methods and tools for system protection engineers to assess the performance of protection schemes to identify and mitigate potential mis-operations. Additionally, provide guidance and tools for transmission planners to determine to what extent protection
 systems may need to be explicitly represented in planning models for various study types.
</li><li>Develop probabilistic and risk-based planning methods and tools incorporating all sources of system uncertainty and metrics, criteria, and a framework for making investment decisions based on the probabilistic analysis results.
</li><li>Develop guidelines for conducting planning studies for ensuring reliable operation of the transmission system during geomagnetic disturbances (GMD) and develop models and tools to support GMD-driven harmonic assessments.
</li><li>Develop methods and guidance for modeling and evaluating general transmission harmonic distortion which might result from increasing power electronic load and high levels of inverter-based resources.
</li><li>Develop guidelines and models to support time-domain transient study assessments such as temporary overvoltage (TOV), transient recovery voltage (TRV), and general switching studies.
</li><li>Develop methods and tools for synthesizing advanced contingencies such as stuck breaker or internal bus faults, as well as methods and tools for screening and prioritizing these contingencies for more detailed study.

<p>Planning the transmission system to reliably perform under anticipated future operating scenarios requires models that faithfully represent the behavior of the interconnected system, which requires that the development and validation of models of the various
 components comprised by the system.&nbsp; With the emergence of new generation and transmission technologies and the ever-increasing complexity of loads that respond dynamically to power system changes, there is a clear need to improve component and system dynamic
 models:</p>
<ol>
<li>The need for continued development and improvement of models for various power system components (particularly improving aggregation of loads etc.) and advanced technologies such as HVDC.
</li><li>The need to continue to explore improvements in procedures and methods for system wide model validation.
</li></ol>
<p>This project aims to work on these two tasks, and is a continuation of previous EPRI research in this area.</p>

<p>The optimal performance of protection relays is critical to the safe, reliable and stable operation of modern power systems. When a disturbance occurs on a power system the protection systems should act in concert to isolate faulted equipment while maintaining
 the stability of the power system and minimizing power outages. Protection systems have grown in complexity, speed and reliability since the early days of power systems and modern relays have the capability to provide very reliable and selective fault detection
 and isolation. However, the optimal application of these capabilities presents a key challenge to modern protection engineers.</p>
<p>With more complex and configurable functions comes a longer learning period for protection engineers to fully understand how each function works for each relay and to map out processes for establishing the optimal settings for each new installation. The
 optimal settings not only take into account prudent coordination of primary and backup protection relays, but also balancing sensitivity of fault detection with security of operation during stressed system conditions. In addition to coordinating primary and
 backup protection with each other, the protection schemes must also operate fast enough to prevent generator or system instability and perform correctly should instability or other major system disturbance occur. This research aims to address this challenge
 of balancing security, sensitivity and selectivity through the analysis of protection models not only in traditional protection coordination study tools used by protection engineers, but also in transient stability and contingency analysis tools applied by
 operations and planning engineers.</p>
<p>Modern transmission protection relays and other substation intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) provide a wealth of information that may be used for disturbance analysis, evaluating protection system performance and validating power system models. While
 system studies are used to optimize the configuration and setting of protection relays, they cannot account for relays operating in an unanticipated manner due to internal or external component failure. Prior research in this project has focused on using IED
 data for determining fault location on transmission lines and validating transmission line impedances. The current research focuses on using data from protection relays and digital fault recorders to analyze protection system performance; this is to both identify
 and assess those relays that tripped as well as analyzing backup protection relays to ensure that they had detected the fault and were prepared to trip should primary protection fail. The data is further analyzed to accelerate the root-cause identification
 of power system disturbances and aid system operator decision and corrective actions.</p>

<p>Significant changes occurring in the power industry due to retirement of fossil generation, increasing levels of renewable generation and advent of distributed energy resources (DER) pose challenges to future transmission planning. Conventional approaches
 and tools used thus far may not be sufficient for future planning needs as they are not designed to handle distributed, uncertain generation and load-side resources.</p>
<p>Also as the nature of power system is changing, it is becoming challenging to assess reliability of transmission systems. Emerging transmission planning requirements and standards (e.g., NERC TPL-001-4) require a comprehensive set of contingencies to be
 evaluated. These contingencies include many categories, some of which require breaker-node modeling of transmission substations which can be quite involved. Considering all categories of contingencies for a practical system could result in quite a large number
 of contingencies. Evaluating these could be significantly labor- and resource-intensive process, especially for time domain simulations for stability assessments. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop methods and tools that can make the process of contingency
 assessment more efficiently and at the same time meet standard benchmarks.</p>

<p>The electric power industry is experiencing rapid physical, institutional, and regulatory changes that are increasing uncertainty that may have ramifications for reliability and the cost of providing reliable electric service. The main drivers of these changes
 are the advent of open transmission access and deregulated energy markets across wider geographic regions, the growing prominence of remote variable generation resources such as wind and solar photovoltaic, demand-side resources such as demand response, residential/commercial
 PV, and electric vehicles, and evolving environmental regulations and capital/fuel cost changes that are influencing generation fleet.</p>
<p>These factors are significantly increasing the uncertainty as to future supply resources to be developed, future demand levels that must be served, and the resulting specific generation dispatch and associated power flows that will result. As such, it is
 becoming more difficult, if not impossible, for planners to evaluate all near- and long-term reliability considerations when considering planning projects. The existing planning processes and tools, which are mostly deterministic, may not be adequate to address
 these challenges. This may result in a failure to study a particular scenario that may have reliability implications or the tendency to over-build the system to account for the uncertainty. Therefore, there is a need to develop new risk-based analysis methods
 and tools that can be integrated with existing planning processes to explicitly consider many of these noted uncertainties. Augmenting existing, deterministic-based planning processes with risk-based planning methods may yield a framework that can address
 the dimensionality introduced by the uncertainties in data and forecasts which cannot be captured in a deterministic framework because an impossibly large number of deterministic studies would be required to assess each possible combination of outcomes. However,
 there are challenges in incorporating risk-based planning in transmission due to lack of standard methodologies, lack of widespread knowledge among practicing engineers, and lack of data and tools, among other factors. Therefore, there is an industry need
 for concerted R&amp;D efforts to evaluate potential benefits of including probabilistic methods and accordingly to develop methods, tools, metrics, and data processes to support their integration in the planning process.</p>
<p>In addition, utilities are increasingly being exposed to threats from natural disasters (hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, GMD etc.) and man-made events (terrorism, electromagnetic etc.) which can devastate generation, T&amp;D infrastructure, and threaten lives
 and disable communities. These events typically have quite a low probability of occurrence but can wreck tremendous damage to infrastructure. Given the limited resources and investment dollars available, it is necessary to know which system hardening options
 can provide most bang for the buck. The existing planning approaches and tools do not lend themselves to analyze and plan for these events and address the challenge of where and how to invest. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods and tools that will
 enable planners to assess resiliency of grid against such events and make sound investment decisions. This is a new multi-year research effort that will be started from 2016.</p>

<p>This research project provides for R&amp;D to address special planning studies for addressing specific issues that must be considered in the broader planning process. In 2016, research was conducted to aid planners in conducting studies to evaluate the impacts
 of Geomagnetic Disturbances (GMD) on system reliability and to provide a guidance on modeling and simulating transmission harmonic impacts and guidelines for conducting transient recovery voltage (TRV) and temporary overvoltage (TOV) studies.&nbsp; In 2017, this
 project will focus on potential transmission harmonic distortion associated with harmonic injections for transformers during a GMD event or from other drivers such as high levels of inverter-based resources.&nbsp; Additionally in 2017, research will continue to
 provide guidance on modeling and simulation-based time-domain transient studies that may be required for transmission planning.</p>

<p>During geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) events, magnetic field variations at the earth’s surface drive low-frequency electric currents along transmission lines and through transformer windings to ground.&nbsp; These geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) cause half-cycle
 saturation of transformers leading to harmonic generation, increased reactive power losses, and heating of transformer windings and structural components. The combination of protection system misoperation due to harmonics and increase in reactive power absorption
 can result in voltage collapse.&nbsp; This phenomenon was experienced in March 1989 when the Hydro Quebec network experienced voltage collapse when seven static var compensators were removed from service when their protection systems operated due to their sensitivity
 to harmonics. Additionally, harmonics created by half-cycle saturation have the potential to affect the operation of both synchronous and inverter-based generation.&nbsp; Effects on synchronous generators, although to a lesser degree, were experienced during the
 March 1989 event.</p>

<p>Voltage and current harmonics have been present on power transmission systems since their earliest days. Historically, the topic has been of primary interest on distribution and industrial power networks where distorting loads and loads sensitive to harmonics
 are both commonly found. For many transmission systems, however, the issue of harmonics was less often the focus of attention except in the case of large non-linear loads like arc furnaces or distorting power electronics devices like SVC or HVDC. Even for
 such cases where the harmonic emissions are from a single source or a small number of sources at a single substation there are many challenges to the accurate development of transmission models and performing the necessary analysis and interpretation of the
 results.</p>
<p>The power electronics used to interface many modern devices to the power system generate voltage and current harmonics due the switching process to convert power between dc and ac. While such devices were comparatively rare in the past, they have become
 increasingly prevalent due to the wider deployment of power electronic converters and their application as the interface between energy sources, loads and storage devices and power systems, as well as increased application of FACTS devices such as SVC and
 STATCOMs. As these devices are spread around the system they cannot necessarily be analyzed in isolation, and so, assessing the net impact of these distributed variable harmonic sources is more challenging. As the location experiencing harmonic distortion
 may be remote from the source or at a different voltage level the transmission engineer is posed with the question of how much of the network to model. Increasing the size of the model not only increases the time required to collect the required data and set
 up the study, but also extends the number of operational scenarios (generator dispatches, loads, outages) to consider in order to comprehensively study the network and identify possible breaches of harmonic distortion limits. Furthermore, the types of operational
 scenarios themselves (peak, valley, shoulder) determine the level of damping in the system and can be more difficult to define with significant local penetration of renewables. In the absence of industry-standard guidelines on modelling transmission systems
 for harmonics studies a research gap exists for evaluating network model depth and detail in order to accurately capture harmonic phenomena while minimizing model development time.</p>
<p>With the short-term planning time-lines associated with many new transmission-projects – including FACTs devices, data centers, renewable energy sources and energy storage – it can be more difficult to design flexible harmonics mitigation devices. A harmonics
 mitigation device designed for the system as it is today may be inadequate or exacerbate future harmonics with unforeseen grid developments. Thus, there can be wide ranging benefits from the development of a standardized design approach for more flexible mitigation
 devices including such topics as physical layout of filter banks, minimizing component values across the fleet of filter banks on a system to permit re-use and replacement and re-configuration, and the application of active harmonic cancellation devices.</p>
<p>While some of the issues above have been addressed for distribution and industrial systems, the guidelines and philosophies cannot always be directly translated for application to the transmission system. The aim of this research project is to address those
 issues for transmission grids and provide clear guidance for the analysis and mitigation of harmonics on transmission systems.</p>

<p>Switching transients relate to the high frequency transient phenomena that primarily occur after operation of disconnects and circuits breakers, but also after other system disturbances such as the initiation of short circuits. The modelling requirements
 for switching transient studies are much more onerous than for conventional load-flow studies and are quite different to those models required for stability studies. Allied to this is the fact that only a small portion of the larger network may be modeled
 in order to ensure that the simulation completes within an acceptable time-frame. As a result engineers are often required to develop bespoke network models on a per-study basis. This can have the consequence that switching transient studies can be time consuming
 to complete as the engineer collects detailed equipment data and test reports, develops the model, configures the simulation and analyzes the results.</p>
<p>Transmission systems are seeing greater use of EHV lines, longer underground cables, replacement/upgrade of existing equipment and more connection requests for sensitive loads and generators. In addition to this there are more frequent use of gas insulated
 switchgear and emerging technologies such as gas insulated transmission lines and superconducting conductors, which have their own challenges for modelling and analysis during switching events. This is leading to transmission planners and transmission engineering
 designers facing increasing requirements to perform switching transients studies in order to ensure adequate insulation coordination, selection of circuit breakers, sizing surge arrestors, design of opening/closing resistors, choosing between replacing relatively
 high maintenance opening/closing resistors with surge arrestors or synchronized switching and calculating safe minimum approach distances for live-line work.</p>
<p>Switching transient studies are computationally challenging. Over the years many simplifying assumptions have been adopted in order to speed up simulation time, but such simplifying assumptions tend to decrease simulation accuracy and result in conservative
 solutions. These conservative solutions feed into the equipment design process and may result in higher specification equipment, additional mitigation devices or operational limitations. More accurate simulations based around the research undertaken in this
 project could result in reduced error margins and better optimized designs without sacrificing reliability or safety.</p>
<p>Technology changes also impact insulation coordination and switching studies. For instance, changing between porcelain or glass string insulators to polymeric types or moving from conventional capacitive voltage transformers (CVT) to optical voltage transformers
 materially impact on transient overvoltages and insulation coordination, but this may not be obvious at the design stage. Case studies and test simulations will be used to develop criteria or methodologies to flag when switching studies may be required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Materials degradation can impact nuclear plant safety and reliability if not actively managed. Degradation due to environmentally assisted cracking, for example, can have significant impacts such as forced and extended outages, increased inspection requirements,
 and component repairs and replacements. A deeper understanding of the underlying causes of materials degradation in light water reactors can facilitate effective aging management.</p>
<p>Improvement in fundamental understanding of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) in light water reactor and heavy water reactor materials can lead to more robust models for predicting damage progression
 and to more effective technologies for mitigating degradation. Such understanding can enable nuclear plant operators to effectively manage materials aging issues over the life of the plant, inform decisions regarding life extension, and enable the development
 of materials with enhanced resistance to irradiation-induced degradation.</p>
<p>The Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program collaborates with other EPRI research programs, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Materials Aging Institute, and other international organizations to ensure that research findings reflect a wide range of nuclear
 technologies, operating conditions, and service environments.</p>

<p>The Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program enhances understanding of the damage mechanisms in irradiated materials used in boiling water and pressurized water reactor internals. Research results lead to improved predictive models, more radiation-resistant
 materials, and potential countermeasures that help ensure the safe, continued operation of plant components. Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps associated with irradiated materials testing, including both initiation and crack growth data in boiling and pressurized water reactors</p>
</li><li>
<p>Mechanistically based predictive models of SCC and IASCC degradation to manage materials aging in light water reactor components</p>
</li><li>
<p>Better understanding of SCC and IASCC in nickel-based alloys and stainless steels</p>
</li><li>
<p>New radiation-resistant materials for reactor internals</p>
</li><li>
<p>Methods to mitigate damage and safely extend component life</p>
</li><li>
<p>Knowledge sharing through global collaboration with utilities, vendors, regulators, and research organizations</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The results of the Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program are communicated to the appropriate EPRI programs (Boiling Water Reactor Vessels and Internals Project, Materials Reliability Program, Steam Generator Management Program, Long-Term Operations
 Program) for further development and application. The program also coordinates activities with the U.S. Department of Energy and international entities to concentrate research and development resources on materials degradation and aging issues associated with
 long-term operation of light water reactors.</p>
<p>The Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program provides a platform through which participants can discuss generic materials aging management related issues and connect with other EPRI materials issue programs. The program also ensures EPRI’s materials R&amp;D
 is conducted with an awareness of international aging management and license extension requirements, such as those associated with the International Generic Aging Lessons Learned (IGALL) document.</p>
<p>PSCR has defined several research focus areas to coordinate research activities and advance understanding of the causes of key degradations associated to LWR primary system components. PSCR research focus areas include: IASCC mechanisms and models; void
 swelling mechanism and models; the effects of irradiation aging or synergetic aging on fracture toughness; reactor pressure vessel embrittlement mechanisms; effectiveness of hydrogen water chemistry mitigation; welding of irradiated materials; PWSCC degradation
 of Ni-based alloys; outside diameter stress corrosion cracking and lead stress corrosion cracking of steam generator tubes; stress corrosion cracking of low alloy steels; environmentally assisted fatigue; and radiation resistant materials.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within these research focus areas, research activities in the Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintain and update the Materials Degradation Matrix, the Materials Information Portal, and the Materials Handbook. Revisions to these tools enable EPRI and the industry to update the knowledge gaps associated with the materials issues in BWR, PWR, CANDU,
 and VVER plants, and address technical issues associated with near-term and long-term operation reliability.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Participate in global research efforts to better understand the role of key parameters associated with IASCC of reactor materials and to develop improved materials. As part of these efforts, EPRI develops mechanistically based and peer-reviewed models for
 crack growth in irradiated materials in light water reactor environments, derived from an international IASCC database.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Apply state-of-the-art nano-characterization techniques to investigate the role of microstructure, micro-deformation, and micro-segregation on IASCC susceptibility and loss of fracture toughness.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Conduct mechanistic studies on SCC of nickel-based alloys and stainless steels to develop more accurate and robust predictive models, and participate in international SCC research programs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Explore innovative approaches to simulate irradiation damage in materials used in reactor core components to support development of physically-based models for void swelling.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Develop models to predict environmentally assisted fatigue (EAF) in light water reactor environments based on a mechanistic understanding of EAF enhancement and retardation.</p>
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program supports nuclear power industry efforts to identify and mitigate early stages of materials degradation to extend component life. The program has made progress in a number of areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Revised the EPRI Materials Degradation Matrix (MDM) to update scientific knowledge in degradation mechanisms for the materials used in BWR, PWR, CANDU and VVER primary systems. This revision supported the development of Issue Management Tables (IMTs) to
 accurately capture knowledge gaps in implementing integrated materials aging management.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed an assessment of the irradiation effects on EAF crack growth for stainless steels used in BWR and PWR reactor internals. The results will provide insight into whether EAF issues may be further complicated due to reactor internal environments.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed an investigation of the effects of loading on environmentally assisted fatigue crack growth in stainless steels in LWR environments. This study investigated how loading and sulfur content may retard EAF crack growth. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed a small-volume technique to characterize a given material’s properties. This technique can quantitatively assess the grain boundary cohesive strength in support of PWSCC mechanistic studies and PWSCC modeling.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Together with the Materials Aging Institute (MAI), initiated a program to characterize grain boundary oxidation for Ni-based alloys exposed to PWR environments and to perform grain boundary cohesive strength measurements. This research activity supports
 development of an engineering model on primary water SCC (PWSCC) model for Alloy 600/82/182.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Transferred IASCC crack growth models to the BWR Vessel &amp; Internals Project and the PWR Materials Reliability Program to further develop into engineering guidelines.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Teamed with University of Michigan, University of Tennessee, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop a plan to perform heavy ion irradiation for rapid simulation of high fluence effects.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Primary Systems Corrosion Research Program research and development for 2017 will focus on improving the understanding of corrosion mechanisms in nuclear materials, leading to more effective management and mitigation strategies for continued operation of
 existing plants and better materials selection for new plants. Specific efforts will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conduct ion irradiation experiments on the flux thimble tube material removed from a PWR plant, with fluence ranging from 0 to 100 dpa. The additional irradiation using multiple ion sources will allow rapid simulation of microstructures of higher fluence
 and enable comparison of results from different irradiations processes, including thermal neutron, heavy ion, and neutron plus heavy ion. The ion irradiation experiments are intended to grow an irradiated microstructure created by reactor irradiation at a
 low to intermediate damage level, thereby demonstrating the viability of rapid simulation of high fluence by ion irradiation. The experiment results will be used to enhance the physical basis of void swelling models for reactor core internal components. &nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collaborate with EDF Materials Aging Institute (MAI) to perform grain boundary oxidation characterization and grain boundary cohesive strength measurements to support development of a PWSCC model for Alloy 600/82/182. Such a model ultimately could help manage
 reliability of Ni-based alloy pressure boundary components.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collaborate with U.S. Department of Energy’s Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) Program to perform an IASCC study of neutron-irradiated stainless steels. This program will develop a model for IASCC initiation and growth based on localized deformation
 arising from irradiation-induced changes to the microstructure. This study will determine processes responsible for IASCC and provide a pathway to a more physically based model for IASCC.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Continue to perform the irradiation studies to support the development of radiation-resistant materials in light water reactors. The project will perform microstructural, mechanical, and stress corrosion cracking studies on proton-irradiated alloys to identify
 promising alloys for further evaluation in neutron irradiation conditions.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Contingent on DOE funding, initiate a collaborative research program with DOE Nuclear Science User Facilities (NSUF) program and DOE Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program to perform an irradiation experiment on thermally aged cast austenitic

<p><em>NRC has mandated EAF evaluation of plant piping and components per Regulatory Guide 1.207 using the methodology prescribed in NUREG/CR-6909. NUREG/CR-6909 is overly conservative. Application of the methodology predicts that the operating fleet should
 have experienced many EAF failures by now. This has not been the fleet’s 40 year operating history. Application of the methodology to an operating plant for license renewal purposes or to a new plant design is costly. Test data needs to be obtained that support
 changes to the NUREG/CR-6909 requirements.</em> </p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Steam Generator Management Program uses an integrated approach for managing steam generator materials degradation in pressurized water reactors. The program develops guidance through improved understanding of how multiple variables impact steam generator
 operation and maintenance, including thermal hydraulics, water chemistry, tubing materials, inspection techniques, and tube-plugging/repair criteria.</p>
<p>The Steam Generator Management Program closely collaborates with other EPRI programs, including the PWR Materials Reliability Program, the Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Program, and the Chemistry Program, to ensure appropriate technologies and technical
 guidance are effectively integrated into research activities.</p>
<p>There are both base and supplemental components of the Steam Generator Management Program. The base portion encompasses NDE research and development, water chemistry, materials performance/thermal hydraulics, and the Steam Generator Degradation Database
 (SGDD).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nondestructive Evaluation: Develops tools such as software algorithms, improved inspection techniques, and database libraries to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of steam generator inspections. Improved flaw detection and flaw-sizing accuracy capabilities,
 for example, can better inform decisions regarding operating intervals between inspections.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Water Chemistry: Develops guidelines, chemistry technologies, and predictive models to minimize steam generator tube corrosion and fouling, and to optimize chemistry for safe, reliable, and long-term steam generator operation. Advanced technology developments
 are incorporated into application sourcebooks to inform water chemistry control actions, including the use of improved amines, dispersants, molar ratio control, and intergranular stress corrosion cracking inhibition.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Materials Performance and Thermal Hydraulics: Conducts experiments and develops computational simulations that more accurately estimate foreign object movements and tube wear rates from steam generator foreign objects. This research area also develops prediction
 tools and on-line measurement techniques to manage issues resulting from buildup on tube support plates. Finally, corrosion studies are conducted that can help determine the effect of various steam generator environments on tube degradation rates.</p>
</li><li>
<p>SGDD: Maintains a web-based database of steam generator information that contributes to the safe and reliable operation of steam generators by providing data to inform decisions regarding inspection scope, tube repair activities, and the effectiveness of
 steam generator corrective actions, such as chemical cleaning.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Research focus areas containing multiple common projects are used to document the strategic objectives for each focused area of research. The Steam Generator Management Program has five research focus areas: Understanding Wear Mechanisms in Steam Generator
 Tubing, Managing Chemistry and Fouling Issues, Managing Corrosion Mechanisms Affecting Steam Generator Tubing, Developing and Employing Nondestructive Examination Improvements, and Development of State-of-the-Art Software for Analyzing Steam Generator Flow
 Conditions. To resolve complex issues that may stretch across multiple focus areas or involve multiple external stakeholders, the Steam Generator Management Program has developed targeted roadmaps on foreign object management, tube integrity assessment, steam
 generator life management, and aging management of the steam generator channel head assembly. Additional roadmaps will be developed as conditions warrant.</p>
<p>The supplemental portion of the Steam Generator Management Program provides mechanisms for responding to emerging issues and for developing effective monitoring and assessment programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Supplemental Research and Emerging Issues: This project enables EPRI to conduct research to address emerging technical, operational, and regulatory issues not anticipated in annual research planning. This project also facilitates research in specific areas
 that may not be of interest to the broader base of program participants. Such research could include additional capabilities for software products and review of newly developed chemical additives.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Structural Integrity Assessment and Nondestructive Evaluation Field Support: This project develops products to ensure steam generator tube integrity through thorough inspections, condition monitoring, and operational assessments. Cornerstone products include
 the <em>Steam Generator Examination Guidelines </em>and its qualification program, the
<em>Steam Generator Integrity Assessment Guidelines</em>, the <em>Steam Generator Primary-to-Secondary Leakage Guidelines</em>, and the
<em>Steam Generator In-Situ Pressure Test Guidelines</em>.</p>
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Steam Generator Management Program supports nuclear power industry efforts to minimize the potential for steam generator tube ruptures, forced leakage outages, and other steam generator integrity issues. Accomplishments include both technology development
 and technical support, spanning more cost-effective nondestructive evaluation techniques for steam generators to technical input into regulatory issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated the MULTEQ software to include cobalt species, lead and nickel titanate, new copper and nickel species, and the revision of various iron and copper species based on new information in the literature. The precipitation reactions that previously included
 redox reactions were revised to separate the redox and precipitation reactions. This allows a clearer delineation of the redox and no redox modes when running the ChemWorks<sup>TM</sup> Tools. This software calculates the chemistry environment, equilibrium
 speciation, precipitation and volatilization of species at temperatures from 150 to 350 degrees Celsius.&nbsp; SGMP collaborates with Chemistry and Fuel Reliability Programs for continued development of this software.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Released the Steam Generator Deposit Removal Strategies Sourcebook, which provides detailed descriptions of mechanical and chemical removal technologies and industry experience.&nbsp; This sourcebook assists nuclear plants in selecting appropriate deposit removal
 processes for steam generators.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Updated a report on field experience with dispersants to control iron transport and steam generator fouling. Published with the EPRI Chemistry Program, this update provides additional field experience with application of dispersants, including online applications
 as well as shutdown and hybrid applications to achieve better control of deposits in steam generators.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed generic elements to assist nuclear plant owners in assessing the susceptibility of their steam generator designs to U-bend fatigue. This approach can be used for all susceptible steam generators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Revised the Steam Generator Management Program Administrative Procedures in 2015 to incorporate operating experience.&nbsp; This document provides guidance for compliance with NEI 03-08.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Revised the Steam Generator Degradation Specific Flaw Handbook to reflect operating experience and add material properties for Alloy 690TT tubing. This handbook contains equations for calculating structural limits for all known steam generator tube degradation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed a process to streamline site validation of bobbin and rotating probe inspection techniques. The process evaluates the eddy current inspection system as a whole when determining equivalence, rather than assessing each essential variable separately.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>As boiling water reactors (BWRs) age, various types of materials degradation mechanisms can challenge the reliable operation of the BWR primary system. Stress corrosion cracking, for example, first appeared in recirculation piping in the early 1960s and
 was then shortly thereafter discovered in reactor pressure vessel internal components. Materials performance issues across the nuclear fleet were dealt with on a case-by-case basis, focusing on site-specific components, systems, and materials management philosophies.
 This near-term, reactive approach resulted in costly unplanned outages and expensive weld-by-weld mitigation and repair methods that lacked a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the degradation and how to effectively deal with it. A longer-term, strategic
 approach to materials aging management helps ensure that safe and reliable functionality is maintained throughout the life of BWR plants.</p>
<p>The Boiling Water Reactor Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP) provides an integrated and proactive approach for managing materials-related degradation issues in reactor coolant system components in boiling water reactors. The program develops reliable
 and cost-effective detection, inspection, mitigation, and repair guidance to address the safety-significant facets of operation resulting from materials degradation issues.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The BWRVIP addresses materials integrity issues related to the BWR reactor pressure vessel and internals. Research results lead to proven solutions for managing materials degradation, optimized inspection scopes, improved understanding of structural integrity
 during operation, reduced personnel radiation exposure, and improved models to better characterize the degradation of internals components that can be used by BWR utilities.</p>
<p>Program participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps associated with key issues—such as jet pump flow-induced vibration, intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC), irradiation assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC), and mitigation of internals degradation—and
 other activities needed to address these gaps</p>
</li><li>
<p>The technical bases documents for guidance that improves plant reliability</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cost-effective techniques to mitigate stress corrosion cracking of reactor internal components</p>
</li><li>
<p>Options and design criteria for replacing or repairing reactor components</p>
</li><li>
<p>Optimized internals inspection guidelines and solutions to BWR technical issues</p>
</li><li>
<p>Global BWR industry operating experience</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical insights for inspection options that can help reduce outage critical path times, address new degradation phenomena, and provide data to inform regulatory decisions</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The BWRVIP Program takes an integrated approach to degradation management encompassing assessment, repair, mitigation, and inspection. Continuous learning from research and development (R&amp;D) using state-of-the-art materials testing and analysis tools improves
 understanding of materials aging mechanisms. This knowledge is used to develop the technical basis of guidelines for inspection and assessment of materials-related issues associated with the BWR reactor vessel and internals. BWRVIP activities lead to innovative,
 efficient ways to manage degradation without compromising safety. Operational experience and inspection techniques are evaluated to identify best practices that can be deployed to enhance boiling water reactor reliability and alert stakeholders to new or unexpected
 issues.</p>
<p>The BWRVIP works closely with other Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) materials related programs, including the Materials Reliability Program (MRP), Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE), Primary Systems Corrosion Research (PSCR), Chemistry, and Fuel Reliability
 Program (FRP) to ensure appropriate technologies and technical guidance are effectively integrated into BWRVIP research activities.</p>
<p>The program focuses on improving the understanding of materials performance in areas such as fracture toughness and crack growth of stainless steel exposed to high fluence levels as well as the weldability of irradiated materials for repair. Because these
 factors impact materials aging on all reactor types, enhanced understanding of their interactions and their impact on materials performance are essential. Research results are provided in the form of guidelines that help ensure prompt detection of material
 degradation; technical reports to support materials performance assessments; and cost-effective tools that identify and enable degradation management over the life of the plant.</p>
<p>The BWRVIP program encompasses research related to assessment, inspection, repair, and mitigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessment: Develop inspection and evaluation guidelines that provide the scope for what needs to be inspected and a methodology for evaluating or repairing any indications.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Inspection: Develop advanced nondestructive evaluation techniques to improve detection of indications in internal components.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repair: Develop technically based repair criteria for degraded components and compile information needed to safely plan and implement repairs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Mitigation: Provide guidance for implementing effective chemistry-based countermeasures for stress corrosion cracking of reactor internal components.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The program also manages the Integrated Surveillance Program (ISP) for the U.S. BWR fleet, which monitors changes in reactor pressure vessel materials properties due to neutron irradiation.</p>
<p>The BWRVIP uses the Materials Degradation Matrix (MDM) tool along with the BWR Issue Management Tables (BWRVIP-167, Rev. 3) to identify damage mechanisms and the associated knowledge gaps needed to resolve technical issues. Tasks that are developed to address
 the issues are grouped into Research Focus Areas (RFAs) to help communicate the annual work plans. The BWRVIP has 12 RFAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reactor Pressure Vessel</p>
</li><li>
<p>Thermal and Irradiation Effects on Stainless Steel Reactor Internals</p>
</li><li>
<p>Management of Jet Pump Flow-Induced Vibration</p>
</li><li>
<p>Mitigation of BWR Material Degradation</p>
</li><li>
<p>BWR Irradiated Materials Welding</p>
</li><li>
<p>Management of High Strength Alloys</p>
</li><li>
<p>BWR-Related Corrosion Research</p>
</li><li>
<p>BWR Inspection &amp; NDE Technology</p>
</li><li>
<p>Guideline Management</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fatigue Management</p>
</li><li>
<p>Steam Dryer Management</p>
</li><li>
<p>Alloy 182 / 600 Management</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve complex issues that may stretch across multiple focus areas or involve multiple external stakeholders, roadmaps have been developed in BWRVIP addressing jet pump flow-induced vibration, intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) and irradiation
 assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC), and mitigation of internals degradation. The BWRVIP also collaborates on roadmaps in other EPRI programs that have implications relevant to BWRs, including roadmaps on the welding of irradiated materials and irradiated
 materials testing.</p>
<p>Nuclear plant owners can participate separately in a project aimed at maintaining and improving the BWR Vessel and Internals Application (BWRVIA) software code, which performs radiolysis analysis and electrochemical corrosion potential calculations for boiling
 water reactors. Continued maintenance of this code ensures that the latest industry operating experience is reflected in BWR radiolysis analysis.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>BWRVIP research informs the assessment and implementation of effective approaches for managing materials degradation issues in reactor internal components. Research results provide nuclear plants with the information necessary to maintain safe operation
 and make cost-effective decisions for managing degradation of BWR vessel and internal components.</p>
<ul>

</li><li>
<p>Published a report that provides updated load terms, definitions and combinations for flaw evaluation and repair design criteria of reactor pressure vessel internal components to support utility implementation of the BWRVIP guidance.&nbsp; This resolved issues
 associated with GE-Hitachi Safety Communications regarding postulated recirculation line break and annulus pressurization loads for BWR internals.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed a methodology that can be used to assess the technical viability of a requirement to examine core plate bolting.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Published Revision 19 of the examination guidelines for reactor pressure vessels and internals.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Materials aging effects must be managed effectively to ensure safe and reliable functionality is maintained throughout the life of the plant. Stress corrosion cracking and other degradation mechanisms in reactor coolant system components have resulted in
 forced and extended outages, increased inspection requirements, and component repairs and replacements. A better understanding of crack initiation and propagation processes and environmental corrosion in reactor coolant system components can help in developing
 reliable predictive models and cost-effective mitigation technologies.</p>
<p>The Materials Reliability Program conducts research to identify and resolve existing and potential issues impacting materials in pressurized water reactor (PWR) primary systems. Research activities inform operational and maintenance decisions for existing
 plants, design choices for new reactors, and regulatory actions pertaining to materials aging and degradation mechanisms. These activities are coordinated among PWR owners and operators to ensure the plants are proactively addressing materials degradation
 and aging.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The primary systems are critical to the safe operation of PWR nuclear plants. The Materials Reliability Program assesses technical and regulatory issues regarding materials degradation in PWRs and pursues cost-effective inspection, evaluation, and mitigation
 approaches for assessing and addressing degradation. These activities provide tools that plants can use to maintain safe operation and avoid unnecessary outages. Program participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps associated with key issues—such as PWR reactor internals aging management and reactor pressure vessel integrity through extended operation—and the collaborative actions needed to address these gaps</p>
</li><li>
<p>Detailed inspection and evaluation guidelines for susceptible areas of the reactor coolant system in pressurized water reactors</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical bases to inform decisions regarding the extended operation of PWRs</p>
</li><li>
<p>Mitigation, repair, and replacement methodologies for aging degradation mechanisms</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical analyses and technological options for evaluating and managing in-service degradation to respond to regulatory concerns</p>
</li><li>
<p>Guidance and tools for fatigue-specific materials management in existing plants and design guidance for new plants to address environmentally assisted fatigue</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Materials Reliability Program takes an integrated approach to degradation management in PWRs, encompassing assessment, mitigation, testing, inspection, and technical analysis. Through improved inspection techniques, new results from materials research
 and development, and plant operating experiences, best practices can be deployed to make cost-effective decisions. The program closely collaborates with other Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) programs, including BWR Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP),
 Steam Generator Management Program (SGMP), Primary Systems Corrosion Research (PSCR), Weld Repair and Technology Center (WRTC), Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE), Advanced Nuclear Technology (ANT), and Chemistry, as well as industry entities such as the PWR
 Owners Group, to ensure the research is coordinated and the guidance is consistent and effectively integrated.</p>
<p>There are both base and supplemental components to the Materials Reliability Program. The base portion largely focuses on reactor vessel integrity, fatigue management, and irradiated materials testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reactor Pressure Vessel Integrity: To maintain safe, reliable operation within established limits, the structural integrity of the pressure vessel must be demonstrated under a series of normal operational conditions. Accurate methodologies are needed to
 analyze vessel integrity for neutron attenuation through the vessel wall, evaluate the effect of irradiation on the vessel and nozzles, and develop models for predicting fracture toughness as vessels operate longer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fatigue Management: The prospect of life extension underscores the need for accurate characterization of the effects of high-temperature coolant on component fatigue life, including design rules and inspection requirements. In addition, although guidance
 to address high-cycle thermal fatigue degradation in coolant system components due to cyclic stratification exists, the guidance needs to be evaluated to ensure it adequately addresses all reactor coolant system components.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Irradiated Materials Testing: Reactor internal components in PWRs may be affected by age-related degradation effects, including general material effects and irradiation-induced effects. Data collected through irradiated materials testing can support PWR
 reactor internals management through extended operation. Long-term irradiation effects are characterized by testing materials removed from retired plants or by conducting irradiation and post-irradiation testing of PWR materials at test reactors.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The supplemental portion of the Materials Reliability Program largely targets research needs related to nickel-base alloy aging management, pipe rupture probability, and reactor internals aging management.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nickel-Base Alloy Aging Management: This project develops pragmatic technical guidance for inspecting, mitigating, and managing nickel-base alloys in PWRs to ensure safe operation and a low probability of safety-significant leakage. By reviewing the latest
 field results and comparing them to original assumptions in the technical basis for the guidelines, the Materials Reliability Program can identify best practices for managing nickel-base alloy issues.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pipe Rupture Probability Reassessment: Through a collaborative effort between EPRI and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Materials Reliability Program is re-evaluating the analytical basis upon which the leak-before-break principle was developed
 for coolant system piping in PWRs. The program is responsible for several tasks related to the new calculation, including dissimilar metal weld residual stress measurements, mapping the extremely low probability of rupture (xLPR) calculation, and implementing
 the xLPR calculation plans.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reactor Internals Aging Management: The Materials Reliability Program develops inspection and evaluation guidelines for PWR vessel internals to support the implementation and execution of effective aging management programs. These guidelines are developed
 and updated by integrating information and insights from the irradiated materials behavior database, functionality analysis results, inspection methods, flaw evaluation methods, plant design information, and plant operation data and experience.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Research focus areas containing multiple common projects are used as an approach to document the strategic objectives for each focused area of research. The Program’s 10 research focus areas are: Reactor Vessel Internals Assessment, Modeling &amp; Inspection;
 Reactor Vessel Internals Irradiated Materials Testing; Alloy 600/690 Management, Mitigation and Inspection; Reliability of CASS Pressure Boundary Components; Pipe Rupture Probability Assessment; Stainless Steel Degradation Mechanism Studies; Fatigue Management
 (Thermal and Vibration); Replacement Materials Testing (Alloy 690/52/152); Reactor Pressure Integrity; and Environmentally Assisted Fatigue.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Materials Reliability Program supports efforts to assess and implement countermeasures for degradation mechanisms impacting materials in PWR primary systems. Program research provides utilities and regulatory agencies with the information necessary
 to make technically sound and cost-effective decisions for managing degradation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developed generic safety- and reliability-driven strategies for materials management for nickel-base alloy components, reactor internals, reactor pressure vessels, and piping degradation due to thermal and environmental fatigue.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Published the <em>Technical Basis for Reexamination Interval Extension for Alloy 690 PWR Reactor Vessel Top Head Penetration Nozzles (MRP-375), a</em> technical analysis that uses laboratory and plant operating data to evaluate opportunities for optimizing
 the inspection interval for A690 reactor pressure vessel head penetration nozzles. Nuclear plants may be able to use this analysis to extend the current 10-year inspection interval to 20 years.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Published the <em>Evaluation of the Reactor Vessel Beltline Shell Forgings of Operating U.S. PWRs for Quasi-Laminar Indications (MRP-367)
</em>and the<em> Damage-Based Modeling and Analysis of Reactor Vessels with Numerous Base Metal Quasi-Laminar Indications (MRP-388)</em>. In 2012, quasi-laminar indications were discovered in the beltline ring forgings of two Belgian PWRs during ultrasonic
 inspection (UT). These reports assess the implications of that discovery for reactor pressure vessels (RPV) using either probabilistic fracture mechanics or a novel technique for RPV integrity. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
 cited MRP-367 in its justification for not requiring special vessel inspections at U.S. PWRs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reviewed recent thermal fatigue operating experience, identified gaps in the existing guidelines, and published an Interim Guidance Letter to manage the gaps. The Interim Guidance identified eight “Needed” requirements and two “Good Practice” recommendations
 that, when implemented, will help nuclear plants prevent cracks from exceeding Code allowable limits and prevent forced outages.</p>

<p>Published the <em>Assessment of the Use of NUREG-0800 Branch Technical Position 5-3 Estimation Methods for Initial Fracture Toughness Properties of Reactor Pressure Vessel Steels (MRP-401, BWRVIP-287).
</em>10CFR50, Appendix G requires that reactor pressure vessel integrity assessment use fracture toughness reference temperature, RT<sub>NDT.
</sub>Approximately 46 PWR vessels were fabricated before the ASME Code began requiring the tests to determine Initial RT<sub>NDT.
</sub>NUREG-0800 Branch Technical Position (BTP) 5-3 provides regulatory guidance for estimating RT<sub>NDT</sub> from other available test data, permitting compliance with Appendix G. In early 2014, some of the BTP 5-3 guidelines were identified as potentially
 non-conservative. MRP conducted a joint project with BWRVIP to assess the impact of these potentially non-conservative methods on vessel failure risk. Probabilistic fracture mechanics analyses showed a negligible increase in risk through 60 years of operation
 with continued use of the existing BTP 5-3 guidance.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed Revision 11 of the <em>Inspection Data Survey Report</em>, which compiles inspection data on the total number of components, the number inspected, the inspection methods, and results for inspections required per program guidelines. This report
 provides a high-level overview of susceptible component conditions in the PWR fleet, helps measure progress on industry initiatives, and helps assess aging risks.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Welding &amp; Repair Technology Center combines extensive laboratory capabilities with detailed familiarity with industry and regulatory needs to investigate and evaluate welding, fabrication, and repair techniques. EPRI can replicate welding field conditions
 such as techniques, materials, joining processes, and equipment to create realistic welding environments in the laboratory. Through participation in industry code and technical committees, the program also ensures that the research results inform technical
 bases for code requirements.</p>
<p>To address strategic objectives established for WRTC, EPRI has developed 11 research focus areas to plan, coordinate, and execute needed research:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nickel-Base Filler Metal Weldability and New Alloy Development</p>
</li><li>
<p>Irradiated Materials Welding Solutions</p>
</li><li>
<p>Identify, Research, Develop, and Mature Advanced Welding Processes</p>
</li><li>
<p>Optimize Joining, Fabrication, and Repair Processes</p>
</li><li>
<p>Small Bore Piping Asset</p>
</li><li>
<p>Transfer &amp; Promote Fabrication &amp; Joining Technologies into Codes, Standards, &amp; Regulations</p>
</li><li>
<p>Buried Pipe Asset Management / Repair Solutions</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repair Solutions for Structures: Containment, Fuel Pool Asset Management, Spent Fuel Storage</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tactical Implementation of Repair Methods</p>
</li><li>
<p>Document &amp; Evaluate Operating Experience for Welding &amp; Repair Programs</p>
</li><li>
<p>Thermal Spray Coatings and Hardfacing Applications</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In addition, roadmaps have been developed for certain issues that require cross-industry collaboration among multiple entities. Current roadmaps include: Welding of Irradiated Materials for Reactor Internals; Weldability Assessment of Alloy 52/52M Weld Metals;
 Advanced Welding Process Development in the Nuclear Power Industry; Incorporation of Fabrication, Repair, and Joining Technologies in Nuclear Codes and Standards; and Advanced Welding Development to Support Repairs of Spent Fuel Pools and Spent Fuel Storage
 Containers.</p>
<p>Regular engagement with code organizations and other technical bodies helps inform the implementation of new repair methods, welding procedures, and weld materials within acceptable safety limits. WRTC regularly interfaces with the American Society of Mechanical
 Engineers (ASME) and other code and regulatory bodies to share research and technical results that can help inform decisions and regulations regarding a wide range of component repairs.</p>

<p>Presently, two distinct resolution approaches are being pursued under this research area. The first is optimization of Alloy 52 weldability and strategic development of solutions for specific problems associated with Alloy 52 weldability. The approach addressed
 in this Research Focus Area addresses improved mapping of Alloy 52 and development of tools that provide for improved results associated with Alloy 52 weldability. This solution approach is described in Roadmap NUC_MAT­08­R1. The second approach involves development
 of an alternate weld filler metal that retains adequate margins to PWSCC, but also resolves weldability problems. This&nbsp;&nbsp; approach is described in Roadmap NUC_MAT­09­R1.</p>
<p>Design Applicability:&nbsp; Applicability is judged to be high for PWRs, VVERs, and CANDUs where Alloy 52 is being used. Solutions developed can be applied to both operating and advanced reactors. Applicability to operating BWRs is low due to the limited use
 of Alloy 52 in the BWR fleet to date. Applicability to advanced BWRs is also judged to be low since current design plans include modified Alloy 82 and not Alloy 52.</p>

<p>This Research Focus Area addresses the opportunity to optimize and improve established welding processes and procedures, and to optimize residual stresses through surface conditioning and other techniques.</p>
<p>Design Applicability:&nbsp;There is a broad applicability to both BWRs and PWRs. Applicability is highest for those components having significant susceptibility to SCC and / or IASCC. The greatest opportunities will be related to high-temperature, high alloy
 systems (e.g. NSSS systems), where optimization of welding processes and improved understanding of residual stresses (and the related influence on degradation) is of significant importance.</p>
<p>For advanced designs, there is an opportunity to resolve many SCC concerns through application of welding / joining processes that do not induce significant residual stresses in the weld and HAZ regions. As a result, the applicability of this work, if expanded
 to address new construction, could be significant.</p>

<p>Buried piping can have significant degradation and in some instances the repair and replacement of these systems and components are difficult and costly to the utility. This RFA investigates repair technologies that can increase operable life of buried piping,
 reduce welded repair durations, and research new materials such as non-metallic repairs.</p>
<p><strong>Design Applicability:</strong> &nbsp;From a welding &amp; repair technology perspective, buried piping issues are independent of plant design type and are instead primarily dependent on the nature of the buried pipe and associated design and installation
 details. As such, this Research Focus Area is generically applicable to both BWRs and PWRs.</p>

<p>This Research Focus Area address the need for development of repair solutions for critical nuclear structures, with the current focus being placed on containment and spent fuel pool (SFP) structures. OE indicates that degradation of containment liners does
 occur and is being identified with greater frequency as plants age. Leakage of SFP liners, most likely due to SCC occurring at liner welds, is an ongoing industry problem. This focus area will also include issues related to Dry Cask Storage Systems (DCSS)
 and Chloride Induced SCC (CISCC) repair by FSW and other processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design Applicability:</p>
<p>Applicability includes BWRs and PWRs. SFP repair solutions are independent of design type.</p>
<p>The repair needs and associated solution technologies will be different for BWR and PWR containment structures. Repair technologies developed will need to address several design configurations. SFP and containment repair technologies may eventually be applicable
 for advanced reactor designs (new plants), but are not near-term concerns.</p>
<p>Dry Casks Storage Systems are available in a variety of designs and provided by different vendors, however, the repair and mitigation options will be applicable to all designs.</p>

<p>High-quality repair/replacement methodologies, mitigation processes, and dependable welding solutions are critical to safe nuclear plant operation. The safety significance of component repairs and replacements emphasizes the need for a high degree of confidence
 in the integrity of joining processes and implementation techniques. The use of new technologies and process procedures can lead to extended plant life, higher productivity rates, and improved material properties, contributing to cost savings in maintenance,
 fabrication, and repair activities while maintaining a commitment to quality and safety.</p>
<p>The Welding &amp; Repair Technology Center (WRTC) develops and tests advanced materials, joining, and repair technologies for nuclear plant applications, supporting the implementation of safe, effective welding and repair technologies and procedures in the field.
 The program also supports interactions with code and regulatory entities, providing technical input to inform the development and modification of new and existing code requirements, and new technologies.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Fuel failures and other fuel-related issues can have significant operational impacts on nuclear power plants. Failures, for example, can cost tens of millions of dollars per event to cover replacement power and the costs of a fuel reload if the unit has
 to shut down to replace the leaking assembly. While the industry has made substantial progress in reducing the frequency of fuel failures,
<em>sustaining </em>this success will require continued attention to technical gaps impacting fuel reliability. There are also opportunities to enhance the performance of nuclear fuel under accident conditions through more robust materials.</p>
<p>The Fuel Reliability Program (FRP) drives improvements in nuclear fuel performance and reliability based on issues encountered at operating plants around the world. Research addresses multiple aspects of fuel performance and reliability, including fuel failure
 root-cause resolution, fuel/water chemistry interactions, operational margins through end of life, and improved safety margins during accident conditions. The new knowledge is then applied to update fuel reliability guidance and tutorial handbooks, to develop
 new and enhance existing software products, and to provide technical feedback for new fuel designs. The program also engages nuclear regulatory agencies to provide technical input informing fuel-related regulations.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Fuel Reliability Program develops knowledge, guidance, and tools to maximize the reliability of nuclear fuel and core components. The program also participates in international research efforts to improve fundamental understanding of in-reactor behavior
 of fuel, cladding, control materials, and other core components.</p>
<p>There are both base and supplemental components to the Fuel Reliability Program. The base program focuses on fuel-related issues that generally apply to two or more nuclear steam supply system designs. Projects commonly focus on fuel performance and reliability
 by quantifying fuel operational margins and identifying fuel failure mechanisms through poolside and hot cell examinations. Projects are often cost-shared with fuel vendors to ensure information is factored into subsequent fuel designs, thereby driving improvements
 in fuel reliability. An important strategic focus area relates to advancing nondestructive poolside techniques to quantify fuel performance margins, locate failed fuel rods, and identify the cause of failure, as well as measure distortion of fuel assemblies,
 components and BWR channel boxes. An industry-wide fuel reliability database, which compiles data on failure root causes, fuel reliability statistics, and good operating practices, is also maintained through the base program.</p>
<p>A separate research effort is evaluating breakthrough fuel technologies. Several technology options are available that offer potential benefits in terms of higher melting temperatures and reduced hydrogen generation during severe accidents. Along with the
 U.S. Department of Energy, OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency, nuclear fuel vendors, universities, and other research organizations, EPRI is evaluating and developing promising concepts to overcome potential barriers to commercialization, such as ease of fabrication.</p>
<p>The supplemental portion of the Fuel Reliability Program addresses technical issues with regulatory implications and technical issues confronting corrosion and crud control in both boiling and pressurized water reactors. EPRI informs regulatory issues by
 participating in experimental programs and performing independent analyses to better understand various accident criteria. Areas of focus include the applicability of existing reactivity-initiated accident (RIA) and loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA) criteria
 to high- and intermediate-burnup fuel.</p>
<p>With respect to corrosion and crud control, EPRI research helps improve the understanding of and the links between fuel operation, water chemistry, crud, and fuel reliability in both PWRs and BWRs. The research combines fuel surveillance programs and laboratory
 and mechanistic studies to develop various guidelines and improve predictive capabilities. Plant demonstrations verify that new technologies and changes in chemistry regimes or core operating strategies do not adversely affect fuel performance.</p>
<p>The program has developed 16 research focus areas to coordinate what R&amp;D is performed and how that R&amp;D is executed:</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Fuel Reliability Program distills global experience with nuclear fuel into actionable guidance and insights that drive measurable improvements in fuel reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interim reactivity insertion accident (RIA) criteria have been proposed based on evaluations that combined experimental data from a variety of sources with transient fuel rod analysis calculations. Key to the results were the effects of burnup on BWR and
 PWR fuel rod failures. New data from novel modified burst tests on different cladding materials prompted new formulation of pellet cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI) failure curves for PWRs and BWRs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Critical attributes for fuel fabrication oversight have been documented to supplement the Program’s Fuel Design Evaluation Handbook (FDEH). The FDEH provides technical oversight guidance for nuclear fuel and core component fabrication/manufacturing, while
 contributing to mitigation of defects and performance issues in boiling and pressurized water reactors (BWRs and PWRs).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The Falcon Fuel Rod Performance Code has been updated. This software combines steady-state and transient thermal/mechanical finite element (FE) to analyze light water reactor fuel behavior. The modeling approach employed by Falcon can analyze both normal
 operation and accident conditions for fuel rod average burn-up levels approaching 80 gigawatt days per metric ton of uranium (GWd/tU).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Development of a best-estimate model that is used to predict bounding BWR channel bow performance. The model assists in the evaluation of channel bow-induced channel-control blade interference risk for an existing or planned core configuration—thereby assisting
 the utility and core designer in mitigating that risk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed a new nuclear fuel fragmentation testing technique that allows direct observation of the fragmentation process. Experiments using the new technique are easy and economical to perform, making it feasible to conduct a large number of tests for the
 same cost. Test results have been shown to be similar to those that were seen in traditional integral tests.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conducted a confirmatory fuel surveillance campaign at Peach Bottom 3 following the first application of early hydrogen water chemistry injection in the United States. Surveillance results provided the basis to assess the impact of early hydrogen injection
 on fuel performance for BWRs that wish to apply this technology for intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) mitigation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Conducted a fuel surveillance campaign at Comanche Peak to determine the effects of reactor coolant elevated pH and lithium on fuel cladding corrosion performance. The Fuel Reliability Program sponsored an earlier demonstration of these effects at Comanche
 Peak, but this surveillance campaign bridged a knowledge gap after these units had raised fuel duty and integrated-lithium exposure.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Performed numerous laboratory and hot cell testing and qualification projects to support the application of Frequency-Scanning Eddy Current Technique (F-SECT) to nondestructive measurements of corrosion, metal thickness, and absorbed hydrogen in zirconium-based
 fuel assembly structural components. These projects serve as the bases for transferring this technology to the commercial light water reactor industry.</p>

<p>Falcon helps answer questions on how light water reactor (LWR) fuel rods behave when the unit is operated under various conditions. The software tool provides best estimate values of critical parameters such as local cladding hoop stress/stain and rod internal
 gas pressure/composition, which are essential in making comparisons with design, accident and operational limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Falcon predicts fuel pellet and cladding material states and geometric conditions as they evolve, enabling predictions to be made regarding LWR fuel rod behavior when subjected to an upset loading situation that may lead to fuel rod cladding failures.</p>

<p>Nuclear power's long-term viability depends on continued safe, cost-effective management of used fuel and high-level waste (HLW). An integrated solution encompassing long-term interim storage, transportation, and permanent geologic disposal is achievable,
 but requires significant research and technology development.</p>
<p>The Used Fuel and High-Level Waste Management program examines a range of complex scientific and technical issues affecting used fuel and HLW management, including used fuel long-term storage, used fuel transportation, and geologic disposal. Research related
 to these issues informs regulatory, industry, and national decisions on waste management; supports safe on-site handling and long-term storage of used fuel; establishes the technical bases for transportation of high-burnup used fuel; and provides insight into
 technical advances required to develop an integrated waste management solution.</p>

<p>Better understanding of the options available for managing the technical, economic, environmental, and institutional aspects of used fuel and high-level waste management is needed to inform decision making. The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI’s)
 Used Fuel and High-Level Waste Management program conducts research to characterize the various technical risks and risk mitigation options related to used fuel storage, transportation, and disposal. Program participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps associated with key issues—such as high-burnup fuel transportation, used fuel criticality and burnup credit management in storage and transportation, and extended used fuel storage—and the collaborative actions

</li><li>
<p>Technical analyses and guidance to support safe storage of low-burnup and high-burnup used fuel and high-level waste over extended periods</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical evaluations of alternative geologic repository systems</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical basis to resolve generic used fuel storage and transportation issues impacting plant operability, license renewal, decommissioning, and the ability to move fuel off-site</p>
</li><li>
<p>Development of more realistic methodologies for estimating criticality in spent fuel pools and dry storage, during transportation, and for permanent disposal</p>
</li><li>
<p>Assessment of the long-term performance of neutron poison materials, and a database of the properties of neutron absorber materials</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Used Fuel and High-Level Waste Management program develops knowledge, guidance, and tools to reduce the risks and maximize the technical options for safe, cost-effective handling, storage, transportation, and disposal. The program incorporates global
 experience with fuel handling and fuel reprocessing, and collaborates with global entities on cross-cutting research addressing extended used fuel storage, and supporting elements.</p>
<p>Base research activities address the following research focus areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aging Management of Dry Fuel Storage System Components: Given the lack of options for ultimate disposition of used nuclear fuel in many countries, multi-decade storage in dry storage systems may be required. Thus, aging management of storage system components
 subject to degradation is a critical research area. Important storage system components subject to aging degradation include the concrete overpacks used in canister based systems and seals in bolted metal cask designs. However, the thin-walled stainless steel
 canisters used in canister based systems have received the most attention globally due to the perceived potential for development of chloride-induced stress corrosion cracks over time. As a consequence, recent efforts in this research focus area have focused
 on development of the technical basis for aging management of stainless steel canisters. Parallel work is underway to develop non-destructive examination techniques – and associated delivery systems – to allow early detection of incipient cracks in the canisters
 before they threaten confinement integrity.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Criticality Control during Used Fuel Storage and Transport: Control of nuclear criticality is a primary safety concern during used fuel storage. Ensuring safety is addressed by controlling the configuration of the used fuel, the use of neutron absorbing
 materials, or both. As both reactors and dry storage systems extend their operations beyond initial licensed periods, continued performance of neutron absorbers needs to be assured. Work in this research focus area includes testing to evaluate the long-term
 performance of neutron absorbing materials; development of alternative neutron absorbing materials; improvement of computational models used to determine criticality safety margins; experimentally derived benchmarks for assessing the bias and uncertainty of
 computational models; and development of in-situ and ex-situ test methods for evaluating the performance of neutron absorbing materials.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Used Fuel Cladding Performance during Extended Storage and Transportation: Irradiation of fuel cladding material (primarily zirconium-based alloys) leads to changes in the mechanical properties of the materials. Further changes may occur during periods of
 extended storage, such as changes in material strength and ductility. It is important to understand the mechanisms driving the changes, the environmental parameters controlling their occurrence, and the timeframes at which changes may occur. Most importantly,
 it is critical to identify and understand those changes that could affect the performance of the cladding alloys during storage and subsequent transportation. For example, hydride reorientation in high-burnup fuel (&gt;45 GWd/MTU) can degrade the ductile behavior

<p>Technical Basis for Disposition of Used Nuclear Fuel: While most countries have committed to deep geological disposal of used nuclear fuel, no facility exists today. Some countries are evaluating long-term centralized interim storage of spent fuel until
 a national used fuel disposal policy is established and suitable disposal facilities are sited, designed and constructed. Research can inform the technical basis for disposal and/or long-term management plans, including: risk assessments for proposed disposal
 or long-term storage facilities; technical input to environmental impact assessments; input on technical issues related to fuel reprocessing; and technical input to risk assessments associated with transportation of fuel for permanent disposal or long-term
 storage at centralized interim storage facilities.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Through a separate supplemental project, nuclear plant owners can contribute to the continued development, maintenance, and sharing of lessons learned for the Cask Loader software program. Cask Loader provides analyses to support the safe, economic movement
 of used fuel from wet to dry storage with reduced documentation errors.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Used Fuel and High-Level Waste Management program provides specialized technical analysis to support the safe, economical management of used fuel and high-level waste (storage, transportation, and disposal) and to inform decisions regarding the viability
 of various nuclear fuel cycles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessed the economic and radiation impacts associated with accelerated transfer of used fuel to dry storage. The study determined that an industry-wide requirement to move used nuclear fuel into dry storage after five years of cooling would result in a
 net present value cost increase of $3.5 to $3.9 billion compared to current practice. The study also determined the U.S. industry-wide reduction in spent fuel assembly inventory, decay heat, and Cs-137 inventory would be in the range of 67 to 78%, 23 to 32%,
 and 43 to 53%, respectively.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed the development of pressurized water reactor (PWR) spent fuel pool criticality reactivity decrement benchmarks and additional sensitivity studies using operational data from pressurized water reactors. This results of this research are under review
 by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency, with endorsement expected in 2016. The research will inform a pending Regulatory Guide on determination of burnup credit.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Initiated the Accelerated Boral Corrosion test program, a five-year program that aims to understand the performance and potential degradation issues with Boral over extended time (&gt;95 years).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed a broad chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) “susceptibility assessment” to prioritize which in-service canisters should be inspected for signs of pitting or cracking earlier than others. This work will be incorporated in the aging
 management strategy for stainless steel canisters used in dry cask storage systems.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed harvesting of Boral neutron absorber panels from the retired Zion nuclear power plant. These panels will be evaluated for degradation in neutron absorber performance as part of ongoing research on aging management of neutron absorber materials.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Demonstrated prototype robotic delivery systems being developed to deploy nondestructive evaluation (NDE), temperature monitoring and radiation detection equipment for inspection of stainless steel canisters in dry cask storage systems. Demonstrations of
 the equipment at additional vendor and plant sites will continue through 2017 as equipment design is finalized.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Continued collection of data on high burnup advanced cladding properties to support short- and long-term used fuel storage followed by transportation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For the high-burnup demonstration project, completed shipment of sister rods to the test facility; completed design of special penetrations through the TN-32 cask lid to obtain temperature data and gas samples; and completed preparation of documents needed
 to license the research cask.</p>
</li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Used Fuel and High-Level Waste Management program research and development for 2017 will focus on generic used fuel storage and transportation issues. Specific efforts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop technical basis to inform licensing decisions regarding high-burnup used fuel transportation systems.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Obtain additional data on high-burnup, advanced nuclear fuel claddings to support used fuel storage, transportation, and disposal.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Complete external review of the EPRI PWR reactivity decrement uncertainty model by the NRC and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The reactivity decrement benchmarks and associated sensitivity studies provide the technical bases for assessing the uncertainty
 in the estimation of the spent fuel pool criticality (k-eff).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Analyze Boral samples from accelerated corrosion tests that simulate performance over more than 19 years. Compare third-year accelerated test results to the existing EPRI Boral coupon database, which contains coupon data from the past 25 years. Continue
 testing remaining coupons for the next two years to gain better understanding of long-term (&gt;95 years) performance and degradation issues. This will provide information to determine how long Boral will last in spent fuel pools prior to there being enough degradation
 to cause loss of neutron absorber (boron) material.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Continue Zion comparative analysis project of three independent measurement and analysis methods to gain a better understanding of performance and potential degradation issues: complete analysis of existing spent fuel pool coupons and compare to previous
 coupon analysis results; complete analysis of the results of in situ measurements using BADGER after fuel offload from the pool; and complete destructive analysis of sections cut from existing panels.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Complete the development of the aging management guidance for welded stainless steel dry storage canisters; and continue development of prototype NDE systems capable of detecting stress-corrosion cracks on the canister surfaces.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Demonstrate robotic NDE and monitoring equipment delivery systems at additional plant and vendor sites. This effort will culminate in the use of the completed system to perform an in-service cask inspection on a loaded cask.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For the high-burnup demonstration project, complete the fabrication work to modify the TN-32 cask; support NRC review of the License Amendment Request (and supporting Design and Licensing Basis Document); and initiate pre-storage characterization of the
 sister rods.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Selected reports and products may be prepared in whole or in part in accordance with the EPRI Quality Program Manual that fulfills the requirements of 10CFR50 Appendix B and 10CFR21. The quality assurance status of reports and products will be marked and
 identified.</p>

<p>Fuel pools at many nuclear power plants are nearing capacity. While used fuel can be stored safely outside the reactor building on concrete pads, the data needed to load used fuel into dry casks are often in disparate locations, and some are not in electronic
 form. A software program containing the data necessary to meet plant and cask vendor technical specifications can help choose fuel that would meet licensing and regulatory requirements.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Plant owners must be responsive to the changes that can occur in materials and components integral to plant operations. By understanding these material changes in advance of failure, plants can avoid unsafe operational conditions and minimize mitigation
 and maintenance costs. Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is an effective tool for assessing component condition, and depends on correct deployment of qualified technologies, inspection personnel, and procedures.</p>
<p>Power plant owners use NDE to inform engineering analysis and strategic decisions on whether to continue to operate a component, or to plan and execute mitigation, repair, or replacement. The NDE Program identifies and develops technologies to quickly, accurately,
 and cost-effectively examine and characterize nuclear components, and also serves as a focal point for demonstration and qualification. The NDE Program’s research frequently comprises the technical basis used to inform ASME Code or regulatory actions related
 to pre-service and in-service examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A population of proficient, informed technicians delivering robustly qualified NDE technologies and procedures is essential to the safe, reliable long-term operation of the nuclear fleet.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Research results from the NDE Program support deployment of examination and structural health monitoring technologies to the nuclear power industry to minimize unplanned maintenance and maximize plant safety. Tools for risk-informing the examination scope
 help power plant owners make decisions regarding the need for examinations in terms of their contribution to plant safety. These activities provide for higher plant availability and safety, lower operating costs, and lower radiation exposure to workers. NDE
 Program participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NDE technologies, nuclear-specific NDE training, codes and standards support and regulatory compliance support that can shorten plant outages and avoid costs associated with repairs and replacement power.</p>
</li><li>
<p>NDE diagnostic capabilities useful during extended plant operation, informing regulatory consideration of life extensions.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical support to address various inspection issues and challenges: inspection and evaluation guidelines issued through the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and industry materials analysis programs; independent expert evaluation of the results
 of difficult examinations, or of unexpected indication resolution needs; first-of-a-kind inspections; examination oversight that can lead to improved pre-service and in-service inspections and NDE related decisions; and apparent cause or root cause analysis
 of NDE events.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Demonstration and qualification processes for NDE personnel, procedures, and equipment in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section XI, Appendix VIII, and expert assistance in complying with other qualification regimes used
 globally by industry.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The means of a strengthened NDE workforce through human performance analytics, focused advanced multi-media training, and skills inventory maintenance and assessment methods.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The NDE Program significantly contributes to public benefit by ensuring that qualified and advanced examination technologies are available for use by industry to assess material degradation and component integrity. The NDE information is vital to engineering
 analysis of system and component operability and integrity. As plants age, the information provided by the effective delivery of NDE is integral to successful asset management and operations.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The NDE Program develops and demonstrates cost-effective and reliable examination methods and analysis programs that can be integral to structural and lifetime evaluations of power plant components and systems. NDE results contribute to more accurate characterization
 of nuclear component condition and help inform decisions on whether to mitigate, repair, or replace a component, or to continue its operation.</p>
<p>A wide range of NDE technologies are evaluated: ultrasonic methods including conventional techniques, phased array technologies, full matrix capture, and guided waves; visual methods including visible light, infrared, hyperspectral, microwave, and terahertz
 imaging; electromagnetic methods including conventional eddy current examination for flaw detection, nonlinear methods for material properties assessment, and larger-scale methods for rapid assessment of large material volumes; advanced radiographic methods;
 and modeling and simulation capabilities to help assess and optimize the capabilities of all these technologies. Various materials, components, and systems are investigated, including the primary pressure boundary, buried pipe, cast stainless steel, concrete
 civil structures, and spent fuel pools. Research results are primarily delivered as technical reports or guideline documents that are used by nuclear plants and inspection vendors to develop safe, effective inspection strategies.</p>
<p>Research focus areas containing multiple common projects are used as an approach to document the strategic objectives for each focused area of research. The Program’s 10 research focus areas are: Workforce Proficiency; Improving NDE Reliability; Performance
 Demonstration; Cast Stainless Steel; Materials Degradation and Characterization; Strategic Long-Term; Underground Piping and Tanks; NDE Efficiency; Concrete; and Fuels and Dry Storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve complex NDE issues that may stretch across multiple focus areas or involve multiple external stakeholders, roadmaps have been developed in five areas: concrete, remote visual inspection technology, NDE of cast stainless steel, modeling and simulation,
 and NDE reliability.</p>
<p>Technology transfer is achieved largely through evaluation and application support of NDE technologies in field-deployable products. NDE reliability is supported through projects targeted at maintaining compliance with industry NDE requirements, evaluating
 the ways examiners can use low-cost sensor platforms and wearable technologies to do their jobs reliably, and improving plant owners’ ability to fulfill their responsibility for effective NDE oversight.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The reliability of plant systems and components are critical to the continued safe operation of nuclear plants. NMAC develops guidelines and technical reports that provide technically sound maintenance strategies and practices, enabling nuclear plants to
 improve equipment reliability and reduce operations and maintenance costs. The information produced by the Nuclear Maintenance Application Center can be used to ensure safe and reliable operation of nuclear power plants for the benefit of the people that work
 at the plant and the general public at large.</p>
<p>NMAC participants gain access to the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps confronting key issues, such as advanced preventive maintenance, and the collaborative actions needed to address these gaps&nbsp;
</li><li>More than 400 maintenance guides for nuclear equipment and systems, which provide source documents for improved procedures and training packages
</li><li>Assistance and identification of failure-related root causes through access to EPRI research, expertise, and operating experience from other program participants
</li><li>A broad range of maintenance solutions with reduced implementation risks due to collaboration with subject matter experts around the world
</li><li>Templates for establishing preventive maintenance practices and intervals for key components and systems, including portable emergency equipment&nbsp;

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>NMAC conducts research that supports maintenance and engineering improvements at nuclear plants. Long-term research focuses on new methods and approaches that enable sustained improvements to plant equipment, processes, and practices. Near-term research
 focuses on maintenance methods and guidance that can help reduce operations and maintenance costs and improve equipment reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NMAC research focuses on developing maintenance program improvements that can increase equipment reliability and plant performance and on developing and implementing new processes and technologies that can close the gaps between current issues and available
 solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment Issues and Maintenance Guides: Maintenance strategies, fully informed by operating experience and technology advances, can improve equipment reliability, lower operating costs, and increase overall plant reliability. This program area identifies
 and addresses important maintenance and equipment issues by conducting user group meetings each year and compiling data from nuclear plants, vendors, and other industry sources. The maintenance guides aggregate relevant diagnostic and mitigating technical
 advice for addressing key maintenance issues, providing details on problem identification, troubleshooting, preventive and predictive maintenance, and maintenance tasks.
</li><li>Operations and Maintenance Procedures: Bringing essential information to the point of decision-making can drive safe and reliable plant and fleet performance. Access to equipment information and personnel knowledgeable in operations and maintenance practices
 can provide useful perspective and input. EPRI expertise is applied to plant operations and maintenance concerns through direct phone and email interaction, plant visits, assistance with selected plant assessments, and failure analysis reviews when emergent
 issues arise. EPRI staff also use this expertise to develop reports and guidelines that address new or improved methods and processes to enhance nuclear plant performance.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>Research focus areas containing multiple common projects have been developed to document and guide research activities. NMAC’s six research focus areas are: Component Guidance, Innovative Technology, Maintenance &amp; Engineering Practices, Predictive Maintenance,
 and Preventive Maintenance.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Nuclear Maintenance Applications Center distills global operations and maintenance experience into actionable guidance for nuclear plant systems and components. Lessons learned from nuclear plants around the world are incorporated into industry and vendor
 specific technical guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed preventive maintenance templates for portable emergency equipment.&nbsp;
</li><li>Revised the <em>Horizontal Pump Guide</em> to include interactive graphics that enhance technology transfer and support best practice implementation by new and next-generation engineers and maintenance staff.
</li><li>Upgraded the <em>Preventive Maintenance Basis Database</em> software to define optimum replacement and refurbishment times, and to support preventive maintenance optimization through refurbishment/replacement considerations as well as a user-friendly “Vulnerability
 Tool’” to assess changes in PM strategies and identify which failure modes may change with PM changes.
</li><li>Completed initial development of a seal for water-circulating pumps in nuclear power plants that could control leakage by adjusting its shape while in use, potentially reducing plant shutdowns and maintenance costs.&nbsp;A patent on this new seal technology
 is pending in the United States. </li><li>Revised guidance for creating an effective leak management program in response to an increase in plant shutdowns and down-powers caused by leaks.

<p>Secondary Cycle Isolation Valves in power plants provide the barrier between the regenerative thermal cycle of the feedwater/extraction steam/heater drain systems and the ultimate heat sink.&nbsp; When energy in the form of steam leaks from the secondary cycle
 to the heat sink the efficiency of the power generation cycle is reduced.&nbsp; This reduction in efficiency can result in the loss of electric megawatts. The standard method for monitoring for leakage is to have personnel on inspection rounds measure the temperature
 differential across these isolation valves.&nbsp; This inspection program can be manpower intensive.</p>
<p>Technology exists that can potentially provide monitoring on a continual basis for a minimal cost.&nbsp; This technology would use piezoelectric sensors connected to RFIDs to monitor for leakage across the valves. The output from these RFIDs could then be queried
 either by personnel on a set inspection path, or at a monitoring station.&nbsp; This project will determine the most effective sensor/RFID configurations, the sensitivity of the sensors, and the process to use for monitoring the valves.</p>

<p>EPRI has promoted advances in maintenance practices and strategies since the 1980s, beginning with the application of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and then developing the Preventive Maintenance Basis Database (PMBD) to house industry maintenance
 templates for common power plant equipment. To support nuclear power plants in their efforts to more effectively optimize equipment maintenance strategies based on both reliability and cost considerations, value-based maintenance tools are needed. EPRI is
 well positioned to support the development and implementation of such tools.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Plant Engineering Program has established research focus areas that correspond to critical components, processes, engineering programs, and workforce skills and knowledge in a nuclear power plant. Research projects are developed and executed to address
 current and future issues within these focus areas. The issues are identified by EPRI with input from member advisors and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The current focus areas within the Plant Engineering Program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AC Power Reliability</p>
</li><li>
<p>Emergency Power Reliability</p>
</li><li>
<p>Active Electrical Component Reliability</p>
</li><li>
<p>Passive Electrical Component Reliability</p>
</li><li>
<p>Procurement Engineering</p>
</li><li>
<p>Flow-Accelerated Corrosion and Mechanical Erosion in Plant Piping and Components</p>
</li><li>
<p>Plant Heat Rate Enhancement Methods</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ultimate Heat Sink and Cooling Water System Performance</p>
</li><li>
<p>Heat Exchanger Structural Integrity and Performance</p>
</li><li>
<p>Plant Coating Degradation and Impacts</p>
</li><li>
<p>Buried and Underground Piping and Tanks Degradation Mitigation Strategies</p>
</li><li>
<p>Non-Metallic Material Degradation research</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Roadmaps are often developed to plan, coordinate, and execute needed research among multiple entities. These roadmaps guide Plant Engineering research and help communicate ongoing strategies in addressing these key issues.&nbsp; For example, the cable aging roadmap
 is used to coordinate the research gaps and the collaborative actions needed to address these gaps.&nbsp; Additional roadmaps will be developed as conditions warrant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through separately funded projects, participants can gain access to additional resources. The Standardized Task Evaluation Program provides tools that can be used to ensure that the workforce is competent to reliably perform tasks associated with operating
 and maintaining industry facilities.</p>

<li>
<p>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps associated with key issues – such as digital I&amp;C implementation – and the collaborative actions needed to address these gaps</p>
</li><li>
<p>Guidance in setting up automated asset- and equipment-monitoring systems that will improve overall plant reliability</p>
</li><li>
<p>Improved decision-making tools such as control room human factors guidelines, improved information access and visualization, and visualization-enhanced approaches for tacit knowledge capture and training</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical bases for the generic resolution of technical issues for new and operating plants, such as risk-informed defense-in-depth and diversity assessment guidance; cyber security guidance for critical digital assets; and guidelines for electromagnetic
 compatibility (EMC) testing and digital upgrades</p>
</li><li>
<p>Evaluations of new technologies in nuclear applications, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) controllers, “smart” sensors, and wireless communications</p>
</li><li>
<p>Training, operating experience, and lessons learned on replacement projects that will enable plants to avoid costly mishaps and electromagnetic interference events and to implement plant strategies to cost-effectively manage I&amp;C obsolescence</p>
</li><li>
<p>Life-cycle management and maintenance guidelines for existing I&amp;C systems and components such as radiation monitoring systems</p>
</li><li>
<p>New robust sensor designs providing information that can be used for early detection of degradation, for more robust characterization of equipment health, and for decisions related to plant safety, reliability, and cost-effective operation</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Instrumentation and Control Program is designed around three main research initiatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use advanced I&amp;C to improve overall plant health and productivity: Existing plant I&amp;C equipment and functionality do not accommodate up-to-date features and techniques that can reduce costs and enhance reliability and productivity. Expanded capabilities
 can streamline many plant tasks and procedures to reduce operations and maintenance costs while improving reliability and extending component lifetimes. This research area pursues advanced technologies, such as remote monitoring, wireless communication, early
 prognosis, and data visualization that can inform maintenance tasks and intervals, on-line equipment condition assessment, self-testing and diagnostics, and access to plant data.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Develop technologies and technical approaches that reduce the risk of implementing replacement I&amp;C systems: As the nuclear industry transitions from analog to digital technology, there are several I&amp;C-related issues for which the available technical solutions
 are unclear, incomplete, or evolving. Examples include failure analysis, software common cause failure prevention, cyber security, defense-in-depth and diversity, various design considerations for control rooms, and the impact of new technologies such as field
 programmable gate arrays. This research area develops the technical bases to support the deployment and licensing of I&amp;C and human system interface (HSI) replacement systems; develops guidelines for implementing new I&amp;C, information, and HSI technologies in
 nuclear applications; and documents operating experience and lessons learned.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Improve reliability of existing systems and components: I&amp;C systems such as sensors, printed circuit cards and radiation monitoring systems must be reliable to avoid unplanned plant trips and down-powers. This research area develops generic technical bases
 for effective maintenance and life-cycle management of I&amp;C systems and components already installed in the plant. Such technical research is required to maintain and improve the reliability of existing I&amp;C systems and equipment. Key research products include
 maintenance templates for I&amp;C components to reduce failures and inappropriate maintenance activities.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>To address strategic objectives established for each of its programs, EPRI has developed roadmaps to plan, coordinate, and execute needed research among multiple entities. For the Instrumentation and Control Program, a roadmap has been developed to address
 technical barriers related to digital I&amp;C implementation.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Instrumentation and Control Program has provided much of the fundamental basis supporting digital implementation in the nuclear industry and in identifying and overcoming many of the barriers to implementing newer technology. The program also has
 provided the fundamental basis for implementing reliability and productivity improvements.</p>

</li><li>
<p>Developed multiple cyber security products related to technical assessments of installed equipment and design and procurement for new equipment to ensure that cyber security controls are effectively and efficiently applied.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed human factors engineering (HFE) guidance for control room and digital (HSI) design and modification covering planning, specification, design, licensing, implementation, training, operation, and maintenance.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed technical content for circuit card reliability programs, including instructions to increase the reliability and operating life of existing circuit cards and components, and guidelines for the proper handling of printed circuit cards and their components.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Updated preventive maintenance basis templates for I&amp;C components in the Preventive Maintenance Basis Database.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed an Obsolescence Management Guide for radiation monitoring systems.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Designed and tested new sensors such as a prototype solid-state containment hydrogen sensor with much faster calibration times than existing technology and a fiber-optic Bragg sensor for measuring fluid pressures in nuclear power plants that is more robust
 than current technology.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Designed and built a prototype aerial drone, the Severe Accident Mobile Investigator (SAMI), which can provide operators remote visual and sensing abilities during nuclear accidents.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Risk and safety assessments provide information that enables nuclear plant owners to make technically sound decisions about plant design and operating and maintenance practices. These decisions contribute to safer and more cost-effective plant operation.
 The approaches for these assessments are also used to inform online maintenance, surveillance interval extensions, flexible allowed outage times, and risk-informed performance-based fire protection. Further refinement and extension of methods for risk analysis
 and applications are necessary to ensure that their use supports decisions reflecting industry operating experience and improved understanding of plant response; that they can be employed efficiently and practically; and that they make appropriate use of state-of-the-art
 computational advances.</p>
<p>The Risk and Safety Management Program develops risk assessment methods, the guidance to facilitate use of these methods, and tools to make their use more practical and efficient to enhance the safe and economic operation of existing and future nuclear power
 plants. These tools include software developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to perform detailed risk analyses necessary to achieve these objectives most effectively.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Risk-informed, performance-based approaches yield benefits for nuclear plant owners, regulators, and the public. Use of these approaches allows both the plant owner and the regulator to focus on issues truly important in protecting the health and safety
 of the public. The plant owner can also use such approaches to achieve more flexible plant operation and to reduce costs. Risk assessment has improved many aspects of plant safety and performance through broader use of risk-informed initiatives, plant and
 equipment reliability improvements, and better insights gained from advances in probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) techniques.</p>
<p>Risk and Safety Management Program participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps associated with key issues—such as risk analysis of fire, seismic events, and other external hazards—and the collaborative actions needed to address these gaps
</li><li>Research results and technical input that are valuable for utilities operating in a risk-informed, performance-based regulatory environment, including the Significance Determination Process, the Mitigating Systems Performance Index, and globally through
 periodic safety cases and license renewal </li><li>Tools and methods that can be used to increase plant safety and reduce plant and resource requirements
</li><li>A robust, plant-specific framework that supports effective regulatory interactions
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Base research in the Risk and Safety Management Program develops improved methods and tools for conducting probabilistic risk assessments (PRAs). Methods are improved by collecting and evaluating data and experience from risk practitioners who apply PRAs
 in a risk-informed framework. Tools are improved through applied research in numerical and logic modeling techniques and analysis of data for events such as loss of offsite power. Further advances in methods and tools are aimed more explicitly at addressing
 the risks associated with external hazards, such as earthquakes, external flooding, and high wind loads.</p>
<p>Base research also supports stakeholder engagement to advance risk-informed methods within the regulatory context, through meetings, risk-informed discussion forums, and EPRI research activities. For example, this research area develops technical insights
 into the treatment of low-power and shutdown conditions, supports participation in the development of global standards, and assembles guidance on methods and issues for configuration risk management. Finally, through base research, EPRI supports continued
 development and refinement of its Education of Risk Professionals curriculum, which provides a structured approach for developing the new generation of risk practitioners.</p>
<p>Consistent with the other programs at EPRI, the Risk and Safety Management Program has implemented a process to ensure that strategic objectives are addressed through clearly identified research focus areas. Further, EPRI has developed roadmaps to plan,
 coordinate, and execute research of strategic importance among multiple entities. For the Risk and Safety Management Program, roadmaps have been developed to address the technical barriers confronting the performance of PRAs for fire and seismic events and
 for other external hazards (such as flooding and high winds). Additional roadmaps focus activities on low-power and shutdown conditions, and the development of the next generation of software tools.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2017, the following projects will be included in the Risk and Safety Management Base Program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated Risk Technology Users Group. Through the activities of this Users Group, EPRI continues to enhance software tools for constructing and evaluating PRA models. The Users Group provides a forum for users to share experiences and best practices.
</li><li>Modular Accident Analysis Program (MAAP) User Group. The MAAP Users Group supports further development of the MAAP code for conducting severe-accident analyses, and also provides user training and technical support.
</li><li>GOTHIC Advisory Group. Similarly, the GOTHIC Advisory Group is the venue for continued support of improvement to the GOTHIC code for thermal-hydraulic analysis of containments and a wide range of other types of compartments.
</li><li>HRA Calculator User Group. The HRA Calculator User Group promotes consistency in the evaluation of human reliability for PRAs, with a focus on the HRA Calculator as the tool to facilitate that consistency of practice. The User Group also provides a forum
 for sharing practices and supporting further evolution of HRA methods. </li><li>Seismic Qualification Utility Group (SQUG). The SQUG focuses on examining earthquake experience to gain further understanding of the seismic ruggedness of equipment needed for nuclear power plants, and addresses other issues associated with seismic qualification,
 such as guidance for and training in performing seismic walkdowns. </li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Risk and Safety Management Program supports the development and implementation of risk-informed approaches that can be used in making operational, maintenance, and regulatory decisions impacting nuclear power plants. This has been demonstrated through
 projects in which EPRI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducted a comprehensive research review examining how severe accidents in nuclear power plants evolve. The resulting series of reports and the supporting research provide a major contribution to informing regulatory decisions, form the basis for analyzing
 accident risks for the new generation of reactors, and will help ensure the safety of currently operating nuclear plants over their lifetimes. In conjunction with detailed analyses using the MAAP code, this research also provides insights into measures (including
 filtered containment vents) that might be effective in reducing the potential for serious releases after an accident.
</li><li>Completed extensive testing of components potentially susceptible to high-frequency ground motions, and developed guidance for applying the results to focus on only those few components with actual susceptibilities.
</li><li>Enhanced the MAAP5 code for performing severe-accident analysis, addressing insights from the Fukushima accident and other recent developments.
</li><li>Performed detailed technical analysis of the Fukushima accident to gain insight into the course of events.
</li><li>Continued to develop the next generation of risk professionals (more than 200 graduates of the educational program to date).
</li><li>Deployed new computer-based training modules that address elements of PRA technology and use (including in support of risk-informed regulatory interactions), suitable for management and the end users of risk information.
</li><li>Improved methods for developing Fire Probabilistic Risk Assessments in support of risk-informed regulation, including transition to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 805. In particular, compiled a new database that will be the foundation for ignition
 frequencies and other important elements of fire PRAs going forward. </li><li>Released the first version of the Phoenix platform, an advanced software tool used in risk management to support risk-informed applications, including the implementation of flexible technical specifications.
</li><li>Produced detailed guidance for conducting human reliability analysis in support of fire PRA, and developed analogous guidance for use in seismic PRAs.
</li><li>Assembled guidance that can be used to perform seismic evaluations and perform seismic walkdowns in response to regulatory or other actions following the Fukushima accident.
</li><li>Developed an update to the guidance for addressing post-earthquake restart of nuclear power plants.
</li><li>Completed a framework for conducting PRAs for spent fuel pools in BWRs and PWRs, and applied the framework at pilot plants.
</li><li>Produced guidance and pilot demonstrations for assessment of particular types of external flood hazards.
</li><li>Assembled the state of technology regarding risk assessment for high winds. </li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>New nuclear power plants must overcome a number of economic, technical, and regulatory challenges prior to successful licensing, construction, startup, and operation. Some of the key challenges are uncertainty and risk in cost and schedule for deployment,
 ensuring successful startup and initial operations, maximizing potential operational life with manageable operations and maintenance costs, and incorporating modern technologies into plants from a design and regulatory perspective. Many of these challenges
 can be addressed through application of focused Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) technical products and tools that minimize deployment risks.</p>
<p>The EPRI Advanced Nuclear Technology (ANT) Program conducts research and development (R&amp;D) through EPRI’s collaborative model to evaluate and address issues regarding the near-term deployment of advanced light water reactors around the world.</p>
<p>The primary R&amp;D focus is on light water reactor designs, technologies, and projects that can have an impact in time to support plants just starting up, those currently under construction, and those planned for deployment in the next dozen years. This includes
 the current Gen III, Gen III&#43;, and light water small modular reactor (SMR) designs.</p>
<p>An increasing focus for the ANT Program is Gen IV designs and non-light water SMRs. Efforts are focused on engaging stakeholders from industry, government and academia, and on conducting R&amp;D to inform development and deployment decisions regarding these
 advanced energy options.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Research results from the ANT Program increase confidence and reduce risks associated with developing advanced nuclear plant designs by incorporating current plant operating experience and results from focused research and development. The research addresses
 issues that could impact the ability to efficiently license, construct, start up, and operate advanced light water reactors worldwide. As examples, ANT participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The EPRI Utility Requirements Document, a comprehensive set of plant functional requirements developed over the last 20 years to inform utilities considering the construction of a nuclear plant, emphasizing areas that are most important to achieving excellent
 performance with respect to safety, performance, constructability, and economics</p>
</li><li>
<p>Research results in the area of data-centric configuration management, including data interoperability standards, equipment schema, and data handover processes that plant owners can implement to achieve effective configuration management</p>
</li><li>
<p>Materials management matrices for advanced nuclear plant designs that can serve as living documents for managing life-cycle material issues</p>
</li><li>
<p>Equipment reliability knowledge and tools that can be incorporated into new plant designs to increase the potential for meeting business goals such as plant availability and sustainable high capacity factors</p>
</li><li>
<p>Refined methodologies for applying risk-informed pre-service and in-service inspection techniques to advanced nuclear plant designs</p>
</li><li>
<p>Significant research and collaboration with ASME code to facilitate the use of high-density polyethylene in safety-related applications</p>
</li><li>
<p>Research supporting design and demonstration of next-generation nuclear plants, including small modular reactors</p>
</li></ul>
<p>To enable the safe, reliable, long-term operation of new nuclear plants, it is important that they be provided with the best technology available; the Advanced Nuclear Technology supports this objective through research and technology transfer activities.</p>

<p>The ANT program encompasses a diverse set of stakeholders, designs, and technologies. To maximize our impact, efforts are targeted on issues where science and technology help accelerate solutions for new plant deployment and safe, reliable operations. Therefore,
 the ANT Program pursues issues and projects that meet these key goals:</p>
<p>The ANT Program works to <strong><em>reduce the overall deployment risk and uncertainty for new nuclear plants</em></strong> by focusing on R&amp;D that can reduce the cost of new plant construction through increased construction speed and first-time quality,
 and reduce the cost of systems and components and their installation.&nbsp; The program also targets projects that improve lifetime operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, facilitate high capacity factors through increased equipment reliability and reduced material
 degradation, and use technology to reduce O&amp;M costs.</p>
<p>The ANT Program also <strong><em>supports the development and application of</em></strong><strong><em>new and existing technology to reduce costs and increase safety and reliability</em></strong>. Technology application takes two forms. Existing technologies
 from inside and outside the nuclear industry are leveraged to make those technologies available to new nuclear plants. This is done by finding, defining, and extending useful and valuable existing technologies; performing necessary R&amp;D to prove the efficacy
 of those technologies in nuclear applications; and working with codes and standards bodies and informing regulators to ensure that new technologies are usable. The ANT Program also performs R&amp;D to help solve challenges brought by new plant designs in the areas
 of construction and O&amp;M that need resolved to ensure optimized performance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the ANT Program <strong><em>facilitates common approaches across the fleet through use of the EPRI collaborative model</em></strong>. EPRI has a long history of using its collaborative model to generate industry standardization through common approaches
 and cooperation in developing technologies, processes, and guidance. This model can help facilitate adoption, particularly though codes and standards bodies, and help streamline regulator interaction through independent thought leadership. EPRI has shown over
 the years that use of the collaborative model can significantly reduce costs and increase safety and reliability.</p>
<p>The ANT program has identified three technical research areas to guide its efforts related to risk reduction, use of advanced technology, and fleet-wide approaches.</p>
<p>Projects and issues within the <strong><em>Engineering, Procurement, and Construction</em></strong> technical area primarily address the siting, design, construction materials, and construction activities of the physical plant, including modular construction.
 Key objectives are to help decrease construction costs, improve schedule, and maximize quality.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Materials and Components</em></strong> technical area primarily addresses class 1, 2 and 3 piping systems and related components such as valves, heat exchangers, and pumps. Research activities aim to determine optimal methods for fabrication,
 installation, and operation; identify and develop new applications of materials and components; and identify and develop new or improved methods for joining, inspecting and maintaining piping and components to support decreased installation and O&amp;M costs and
 increase reliability and safety.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Modern Technology Application</em></strong> technical area aims to maximize the use of existing, new, and potentially non-nuclear enabling technology in new nuclear plants. Technologies such as digital I&amp;C, digital and multi-reactor control
 rooms, improved sensors, process automation, data management, and fleet wide monitoring offer potential for increased reliability and reduced O&amp;M costs through an increase in operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The ANT Program purposefully collaborates across EPRI to ensure our sibling research programs are prepared to take on oversight of key issues affecting newer designs as they mature and gain operational experience.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The generation of radiological hazards is an inherent byproduct of nuclear plant operation. Proper management of radiation exposure is a top priority for the nuclear industry to protect workers and the public, meet industry performance goals, comply with
 regulations, and be good stewards of the environment.</p>
<p>The Radiation Safety Program conducts research to manage radiological risks to workers, members of the public, and the environment for the complete life cycle of a nuclear power plant. The program investigates improvements to nuclear plant operational and
 decommissioning practices that can enhance public and worker safety while reducing risks associated with waste management and radiation exposure.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Effective management of the radiological hazards produced by nuclear power is important for continued safe operation of the global fleet, the development of new plants, and plant decommissioning at end of life. The Radiation Safety Program develops guidelines
 and technologies for cost-effective low-level waste management and disposal, tools and strategies for dose and source term/radiation field reduction, and guidance for groundwater and environmental protection. Radiation Safety Program participants gain access
 to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strategic roadmaps outlining research gaps across multiple organizations and the collaborative actions needed to address these gaps. Active roadmaps address source term reduction and low-dose radiation risk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technologies, evaluations, and guidelines that can reduce the generation and disposal of solid and liquid low-level waste (LLW). LLW evaluations, for example, have identified optimization recommendations valued at more than $75 million per year.</p>
</li><li>
<p>New source-term reduction and radiation protection techniques that can reduce radiation dose rates and worker exposure. Source-term reduction studies have identified methods for reducing radiation fields by as much as 50% over five years.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical guidance for early detection, mitigation, and remediation of groundwater contamination, an issue of public and regulatory concern.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical guidance for improved monitoring and protection of workers.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Advanced ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) planning and dose reduction tools for high dose tasks.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Technical guidance for risk-informed regulations in low-level waste, radiation protection, and groundwater protection that can address public safety and environmental stewardship concerns.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Comprehensive evaluations of low-dose radiation health effects and risks to inform radiation protection standards, practices, and communication.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Radiation Safety Program develops guidance and tools to reduce the risks and costs associated with waste management, radiation protection, and environmental protection. The program also conducts plant evaluations and captures generic lessons learned
 that can be shared across the industry.</p>
<p>There are both base and supplemental portions of the program. Base research focuses on developing program guidance and the tools and technologies to reduce waste volumes, worker radiation dose, and groundwater impacts from nuclear plant operations and decommissioning
 activities. To address strategic objectives established for its programs, EPRI has developed seven research focus areas to describe the current work of the Radiation Safety program.</p>
<p><strong>ALARA Strategies and Technologies: </strong>Worker exposure is optimized when you take into account both radiation field reduction strategies, such as source term control and shielding, and work process or equipment design improvements that result
 in less time (or no time) spent in the radiation field or the ability to do the work remotely or from a greater distance from the source. This research focus area includes research related to the use of remote technologies, advanced ALARA planning tools that
 includes a decision logic for source term reduction, novel shielding applications, and high-dose job optimization strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Radioactivity Generation and Control (Source Term Reduction): </strong>
The reduction of plant radiation fields and plant effluents is a continual activity at many plants. This area of research and development is collaboratively funded with the Water Chemistry program and addresses the need to expand and enhance understanding of
 radioactivity and radiation field generation and transport processes. Based on the fundamental understanding of the generation process, tools and techniques are evaluated and developed to improve control of radioactivity for reducing radiation fields and effluents.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Radiation Safety Guidance: </strong>The primary goals of nuclear plant radiation safety programs are the protection of people and the environment. Guidelines and sourcebooks are the tools that enable these goals to be consistently met. The Radiation
 Safety Program has developed a series of guidelines and sourcebooks in the areas of radiation protection, source term reduction, radiological environmental protection, and low-level waste management that inform plant practices; in some cases, these guidelines
 are considered global standards.</p>
<p><strong>Radiation Measurements and Dosimetry for Workers and Public: </strong>
Radiation protection programs rely on detection technologies to identify and quantify radioactive hazards in the workplace and general environment. This information is used with exposure assessments to quantify the dose to workers and the public. This research
 focus area investigates advanced detection and monitoring technologies and provides recommendations for how the information from these technologies could be used to inform source reduction, dose reduction, and effluent strategies. In addition, more accurate
 dosimetry and dose calculation methodologies will be investigated to improve the quantification of the dose to workers and the public.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization of Industrial and Radiological Safety: </strong>Radiation Safety and Industrial Safety are two of the safety pillars for the nuclear industry. At times, however, efforts in these areas may be done without fully understanding potential
 unintended consequences for those elements common to both programs. An optimized approach, strategy, and guidance will be developed in this research focus area to address situations where radiological and industrial safety concerns are present so that an optimum
 decision can be made to better protect the worker.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Dose Radiation Health Risks:</strong> Improved understanding of radiation health risks is increas­ingly important for informing regulations and public per­ceptions, as well as informing decisions regarding continued operation of the global fleet
 of nuclear power plants, build­ing new plants, and decommissioning at end of life. The research in this focus area will be used to: 1) Inform regulatory policies governing radiation protection through interpretations of low-dose risk models for consideration
 by the scientific commit­tees responsible for developing international standards for radiation safety (e.g., ICRP, UNSCEAR, BEIR VII, NCRP, etc.), and 2) Support science-based communication of radia­tion risks to public stakeholders by providing the technical
 basis for standardized risk communication documents.</p>
<p><strong>Decommissioning Technology: </strong>Development and execution of a safe, efficient, and cost-effective decommissioning program requires input from many disciplines, and can significantly benefit from prior experience and the availability of innovative
 technologies to address specific decommissioning activities. EPRI’s decommissioning research efforts compile best practices from past and ongoing decommissioning projects, develop structured and practical guidance for executing an effective decommissioning
 program, and facilitate technology transfer between nuclear plant owners and industry experts to streamline decommissioning of nuclear power plants.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Radiation Safety Program supports industry efforts to enhance the safe handling and management of low-level waste and to drive reductions in public, environmental, and personnel exposure to radiation. The program develops and demonstrates innovative
 technologies, converts industry operating experience into practical guidelines, and explores alternative approaches for more effective management of radiological hazards.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Revised the PWR Standard Radiation Monitoring Program (SRMP) and BWR Radiation Level Assessment and Control (BRAC) programs to improve the ability to identify trends, evaluate performance of source term reduction technology, and identify research needs.
 A primer for In-Plant Gamma Spectrometry was published to inform the industry of the various technology options, applications, and benefits of these measurement tools.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Investigated the feasibility of using a simplistic model of the activity incorporation process to predict shutdown dose rate variations from plant operational history and coolant chemistry data.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed a sourcebook to optimize reactor cavity decontamination and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Provided recommendations and guidance for enhancing the risk assessment of systems, structures, and components (SSCs) and work practices (WPs) based on the analysis of historical leaks and spills of licensed materials at nuclear power plants.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed generic scaling factors for technetium-99 and iodine-129 that can be used for low-level waste characterization. Application of these generic scaling factors can result in far greater accuracy in accounting for these hard to measure radionuclides.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Updated the RadBench™ LLW benchmarking software to support expanded international use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed a review of the Atomic Bomb Survivor Life Span Study to advance understanding of dose and dose rate effects. Using that dataset along with the mouse studies utilized by the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII committee (BEIR VII), the
 evaluation concluded that a DDREF of &lt;2 was not substantiated.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Completed a review of the epidemiology and mechanistic studies concerning cataract risks and found that the probable risks for cataracts are likely increased at a radiation exposure level somewhat less than earlier estimates, but there is currently not enough
 information to make any specific conclusion with regard to the chronic exposure threshold for cataracts. The study results were incorporated into the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) commentary on cataracts.</p>

<p>Radiation fields and their source term affect the collected radiation exposures incurred through work activities at a nuclear plant. Many of the factors that influence source term and radiation fields can be controlled, including plant design, core design,
 fuel performance, materials of construction, chemistry regimes, worker practices, outage scheduling, and training. Changes in one area can cause unexpected implications on source term behavior and the resulting radiation fields in another area. The Radiation
 Management and Source Term Technical Strategy Group (RMST TSG) strives to enhance the understanding of radiation field generation and to identify opportunities to reduce worker dose.</p>

<p>Leaks and spills from nuclear power plant operations can potentially impact site soil and groundwater throughout the plant’s operating life and eventual decommissioning. New nuclear power plants under construction should begin developing their groundwater
 protection programs early in the project planning process. A robust groundwater protection program should include an effective groundwater monitoring program to quickly detect and characterize leaks and spills, and a detailed remediation plan that can be implemented
 during operation or decommissioning as needed. Awareness of industry best practices supports the development and continuous improvement of groundwater protection programs.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Decommissioning of commercial nuclear power reactors is a complex process typically requiring ten years or more to complete, at a cost of more than $600 million. As the large number of plants that began operations in the 1970s and early 1980s near the end
 of life, the number of plants entering into decommissioning over the next 10 years will increase. Technology advances in all phases of the decommissioning process can enhance efficiency, reduce cost and schedule, improve worker safety, and reduce waste generation.</p>
<p>Development and execution of a safe, efficient, and cost-effective decommissioning program requires input from many disciplines, and can significantly benefit from utility experience and the availability of innovative technologies to address specific decommissioning
 activities. EPRI’s decommissioning research efforts compile best practices from past and ongoing decommissioning projects, develop structured and practical guidance for executing an effective decommissioning program, and facilitate technology transfer between
 nuclear plant owners and industry experts.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Decommissioning Technology Program provides a structured approach for capturing lessons learned from worldwide decommissioning efforts and for tracking relevant operational efforts in waste management and environmental remediation. These lessons learned
 are incorporated into generic guidance for the nuclear plant fleet. The program also develops and demonstrates technologies that address the unique challenges related to decommissioning. Program participants gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhanced planning tools to guide decommissioning</p>
</li><li>
<p>Lessons learned from decommissioning and other relevant activities at other plants</p>
</li><li>
<p>Evaluation and assessment of results from the application of advanced technologies for decontamination and dismantlement, site remediation, waste management, and site characterization</p>
</li><li>
<p>Basic research and development to enhance the technical basis used in responding to regulatory requirements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Guidance on unresolved issues in groundwater and soil protection and remediation, low-level waste management, site characterization, radiation dose modeling for site release, and license termination</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The efficient decommissioning of a nuclear plant allows the site to be released for unrestricted beneficial use as quickly as practical after plant shutdown. Performing the work in a cost-effective manner benefits current and future customers. Accurate site
 characterization and release also ensures future users of the site may do so with acceptably low risk.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Decommissioning Technology Program evaluates and documents all relevant utility experiences in decommissioning and related areas. This knowledge base informs research and development efforts focused on technical challenges associated with decommissioning
 activities, including development and demonstration of innovative technologies. The program facilitates technology transfer through scheduled decommissioning workshops and plant-specific decommissioning support meetings.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Archive experience and lessons learned related to decommissioning regulations and technology</p>
</li><li>
<p>Assess strategies for operating plants that could minimize subsequent site contamination and waste generation during decommissioning</p>
</li><li>
<p>Identify critical elements associated with development and maintenance of an effective decommissioning plan</p>
</li><li>
<p>Evaluate options for disposal of wastes from decommissioning plants</p>
</li><li>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The EPRI Decommissioning Technology Program captures more than 20 years of experience in the successful decommissioning of commercial power plants. The program also includes nearly 20 years of research and development results covering critical technical
 areas in plant decommissioning, including planning and strategy development, program cost estimation, waste treatment and management, large component/structure decontamination and dismantlement, and final release of the plant sites for unrestricted use. Program
 results are available through technical reports, software, and workshop proceedings. The program also offers a forum for utilities to share current experiences and discuss effective solutions associated with plant dismantlement and decommissioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 2015 and 2016, held decommissioning workshops in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan to bring together utilities, industry and government experts, and experienced decommissioning vendors to review both current technologies and new technologies
 under development.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed guidance for transitioning from operations to decommissioning. The guidance includes a review of regulations and experience globally.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Evaluated more than 200 decommissioning technologies developed by the U.S. Department of Energy for applicability to commercial plant decommissioning. This evaluation resulted in identification of more than 50 field-ready technologies that may be deployed
 to assist in performing a range of plant dismantlement and characterization activities.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed guidance on best practices for management of radioactive wastes during decommissioning. This guidance included experiences from ongoing and completed decommissioning projects in the United States, Belgium, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed guidance on best practices for management of contaminated concrete. This guidance also includes global experiences from ongoing and completed decommissioning.</p>

<p>Water chemistry conditions at nuclear power plants affect material corrosion rates, fuel performance, and plant radiation fields. Inadequate attention to water chemistry can result in increased frequency of out-of-specification conditions that could result
 in plant shutdown, and in extreme cases may lead to rapid degradation of plant components. The Water Chemistry Program performs research and development activities, evaluates operating experience, and develops guidance to optimize plant performance, mitigate
 corrosion, achieve and maintain design fuel performance standards, and minimize plant radiation fields.&nbsp;</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Water chemistry control is critical to the economic operation of commercial power reactors, as well as to the long-term aging management of critical plant components. The Water Chemistry Program develops technical guidance that can be incorporated into nuclear
 plant procedures to optimize water chemistry control. Research results help nuclear plants create strategic water chemistry plans for maximizing plant availability and cost efficiency in a manner consistent with safety and regulatory requirements. Water Chemistry
 Program members gain access to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strategic roadmaps outlining research needs associated with key issues—such as chemistry guidelines for advanced light water reactors and strategies for reducing plant radiation fields—and the collaborative actions needed to address these needs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cost-effective chemistry optimization tools and techniques to improve plant safety, availability, and performance.</p>
</li><li>
<p>New chemistry applications through first-of-a-kind technology demonstrations. For example, field demonstration of EPRI's cobalt sequestration resin (CoSeq™) showed a nearly three-fold increase in the removal of cobalt as compared to typical ion exchange
 resin and planned demonstrations of new online anion analysis technology that could reduce resource burden for monitoring these important species.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Software-enabled improvements in chemistry control, diagnostic capabilities, and staff productivity.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enhanced technology transfer through plant-specific collaborations and technical strategy groups.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On-site assessment support to benchmark plant chemistry and identify opportunities for optimization.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p></p>
<p>The Water Chemistry Program combines basic and applied research with industry operating experience to develop guidance and technologies for nuclear power applications. The program provides a comprehensive suite of water chemistry tools, including guidelines,
 sourcebooks, new operating and monitoring technologies, chemistry control and assessment software, technical strategy groups, and on-site assessments.</p>
<p>Base research addresses many aspects of effective water chemistry control, including technically based chemistry guidance, first-of-a-kind technology demonstrations, and software tools development.&nbsp; To address strategic objectives established for the Water
 Chemistry Program, EPRI has developed five research focus areas (RFAs):&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chemistry Guidance</strong>: The key products delivered from this program include the BWR Water Chemistry Guidelines, PWR Primary Water Chemistry Guidelines and PWR Secondary Water Chemistry Guidelines, which are applied throughout the world and
 are mandated through the NEI 03-08 materials industry initiative in the United States.&nbsp; These documents, in addition to other chemistry sourcebooks, are the culmination and main technology transfer vehicle for EPRI’s research and development activities related
 to water chemistry control.&nbsp; Efforts in this RFA address the needs related to effective guidance for water chemistry control in nuclear power plants as technology continues to advance and understanding of the fundamental processes is enhanced.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Radioactivity Generation and Control (Source Term Reduction)</strong>: The reduction of plant radiation fields and plant effluents is a continual activity at nuclear plants.&nbsp; This research area, conducted collaboratively with the Radiation Safety
 program, seeks to expand and enhance understanding of radioactivity and radiation field generation and transport processes.&nbsp; Based on this enhanced understanding, tools and techniques are evaluated and developed to improve control of radioactivity for reducing
 radiation fields.&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Management and Corrosion Product Behavior and Impacts</strong>: General corrosion of plant components releases corrosion products into the coolant that can reduce heat transfer efficiency and increase fouling of critical systems, potentially impacting
 plant performance and operability.&nbsp; This research area seeks to understand corrosion product behavior to better control the generation, transport and deposition of corrosion products and mitigate the effect of corrosion products throughout the power plant.&nbsp;
 While overlap exist between the fundamentals of corrosion and radioactivity generation, research in this area focuses on the non-radiation field related species (bulk-type species).</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Chemistry Monitoring and Control</strong>: Power plant water chemistry control requires analytical techniques and protocols for effective monitoring, technically based control limits, and techniques to adjust and maintain water chemistry within optimum
 limits.&nbsp; This RFA develops new and enhanced analytical methods, including online analysis techniques; develops new technologies for water treatment, including purification media; and assesses research results to support water chemistry control limits, or in
 rare cases, establish new control parameters.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Chemical Mitigation</strong>: While materials have improved over time, there continues to be a need to understand the fundamental impact of chemistry control on materials degradation modes such as environmentally assisted cracking (inter-granular
 stress corrosion cracking, IGSCC; primary water stress corrosion cracking, PWSCC; lead-assisted stress corrosion cracking, PbSCC; outer diameter stress corrosion cracking, ODSCC; etc.).&nbsp; Past work has analyzed the impact of noble metal application in BWRs,
 zinc addition, steam generator chemical cleaning of the PWR secondary side, and elevated hydrogen operation in the PWR primary system. Near-term work in this RFA will focus on oxygen control alternatives to hydrazine and fundamentals of new environmentally
 assisted cracking mechanisms like PbSCC.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Through separately funded projects, participants gain access to additional research activities. Technical strategy groups provide a forum for nuclear plant operators to discuss common interests related to resins, filters, chemistry technologies (for example,
 zinc, On-line NobleChem™, dispersants), and overall chemistry optimization. User groups focus on improvements and lessons learned and technology transfer through the web-based Smart ChemWorks™ software. Furthermore, implementation and evaluation support for
 a number of chemistry technologies are available—including startup hydrogen injection, feedwater iron optimization, cycle chemistry, startup and shutdown chemistry, zinc application, dispersant application, open and closed cooling water chemistry, and resin/filter
 assessments.</p>

<p>Improved understanding and awareness of the chemistry-related issues encountered across the nuclear fleet – and the responses to these issues – can enable improvements in plant performance. For example, PWR chemists can incorporate many technologies to optimize
 performance based on plant-specific needs and issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Zinc is being increasingly applied to reduce plant dose rates and reduce susceptibility to primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC), but concerns still exist for plants with the highest boiling-duty cores.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Application of elevated hydrogen for mitigating PWSCC crack growth rates of Alloy 600 and its weld metals remains an area of interest, as demonstrated by the increase in industry cycle average hydrogen concentrations over recent years.&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Filter and resin technologies to reduce activated corrosion product (for example, cobalt) concentrations in the primary system remain areas of significant work.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dispersant application in the secondary system to significantly reduce steam generator fouling and improve performance is beginning to gain ground and is expected to increase significantly over the next several years.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In addition to primary and secondary chemistry control, cooling water chemistry guidance has recently been updated and published for plant chemists, providing improved guidance for the use of chemicals to mitigate corrosion, biological growth, and scale
 formation in these systems. Performance metrics have been defined, and can be used to track the effectiveness of chemical treatment.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Recognizing the extensive industry experience in all of these areas, nuclear plants can benefit from the sharing of industry best practices to resolve common technical challenges and contribute to safe, reliable plant operation.</p>

<p>Optimized performance in water chemistry control is desired to maintain chemistry within specifications outlined in the EPRI BWR Water Chemistry Guidelines and to meet plant-specific performance goals. A variety of system designs, septa types, precoat materials,
 resins, and application and backwash procedures are used across the fleet in reactor water and condensate cleanup systems. Depleted zinc oxide addition through the plant’s feedwater system is also applied throughout the majority of the BWR fleet for dose reduction,
 and On-line NobleChem™ (OLNC) is becoming standard practice for most BWRs for mitigation. The impacts on fuel performance, stress corrosion crack mitigation, radwaste and exposure reduction need to be balanced and carefully managed by plant chemists and operators.</p>
<p>In addition to coolant chemistry control, cooling water chemistry guidance has recently been updated and published for plant chemists, providing improved guidance for the use of chemicals to mitigate corrosion, biological growth, and scale formation in these
 systems. Performance metrics have been defined, and can be used to track the effectiveness of chemical treatment.</p>
<p>Recognizing the extensive industry experience in all of these areas, nuclear plants can benefit from the sharing of industry best practices to resolve common technical challenges and contribute to safe, reliable plant operation.</p>

<p>Chemistry staff in the nuclear power industry continue to be challenged by economic pressures and the aging workforce. Highly skilled personnel spend a large amount of time completing tactical but necessary tasks, while the backlog of important, strategic
 but less time-sensitive obligations continues to grow. Tools that improve efficiency in completion of routine tasks can reduce resource burdens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Continued improvements to EPRI’s SMART ChemWorks product – a web-based data evaluation tool that identifies abnormal
 chemistry and alerts staff to deficient conditions – will enable nuclear plants to function more efficiently.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Nuclear power plants around the world are an important source of non-carbon emitting generation. Even when major plant components must be replaced or upgraded to extend operating life, these plants often represent a cost-effective, low-carbon asset. The
 decision to extend nuclear plant life involves a host of interrelated technical, economic, regulatory, and public policy issues. Unknown or uncertain technical inputs impact the decision-making process both directly and indirectly: directly, through design
 and operational contingencies; and indirectly, through impacts on regulatory actions and public policy.</p>
<p>Recognizing the many technical challenges confronting extended nuclear plant operations, the Long-Term Operations Program is conducting an array of research and development (R&amp;D) activities to ensure that the public, nuclear plant owners, regulatory agencies,
 and all interested stakeholders have the information needed to make sound decisions regarding the ability of a nuclear plant to sustain safe, reliable, and economic operations.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Long-Term Operations (LTO) Program is developing the technical information on which to base decisions regarding extended nuclear plant life. Research results will not only inform those plant owners considering life extension past 30, 40, or 60 years,
 but also those with relatively younger plants considering the long-term impacts of aging. Participants in the LTO program gain access to technical solutions and information to support the following needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identifying key technical barriers that may be life limiting</p>
</li><li>
<p>Investigating cost-effective modernization opportunities</p>
</li><li>
<p>Informing potential regulatory issues</p>
</li><li>
<p>Informing business case decisions for extended operations</p>
</li><li>
<p>Defining the technical basis for aging management programs that can support safe, long-term operations</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Research conducted through the LTO Program provides the public, nuclear plant owners, regulatory agencies, and other interested stakeholders with the information needed to make sound decisions regarding the ability of a nuclear plant to sustain safe, reliability,
 economic operations.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The factors driving interest in long-term nuclear plant operations correspond to specific challenges where technical insight can effectively inform decision making. Although these challenges touch different aspects related to long-term operations – from
 the physical condition of the plant to the allocation of capital budgets for plant refurbishment – they all require focused R&amp;D to ensure that technical constraints and opportunities are fully understood. The LTO Program is designed to address these constraints
 and opportunities.</p>
<p>The program accomplishes its objectives through an integrated strategy that involves research defined by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), collaboration on complementary research activities with the Department of Energy's (DOE) Light Water Reactor
 Sustainability (LWRS) Program, and engagement with other global entities such as the Materials Aging Institute, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), CANDU Owners’ Group (COG), and Japan’s Central Research Institute for the Electric Power Industry
 (CRIEPI).</p>
<p>The activities conducted through the LTO Program are identified in association with nuclear plant owners, regulators, and other key stakeholders. The project also builds on the technical experience and expertise accumulated through EPRI leadership in the
 U.S. license renewal effort in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>Research activities are focused in six technical areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primary system metals material aging, including the reactor pressure vessel</p>
</li><li>
<p>Concrete and containment aging</p>
</li><li>
<p>Risk and safety analysis methods</p>
</li><li>
<p>Instrumentation and control and information technology</p>
</li><li>
<p>Electrical cable aging</p>
</li><li>
<p>Aging management programs, plant demonstrations and pilot projects.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI's LTO Program is a large research effort with broad collaboration across EPRI technical program areas and EPRI’s research partners. Key recent results include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintenance and updates to a prioritized Long-Term Operation Issue Tracking Table. This table is the basis for collaborative R&amp;D programs between the DOE, NRC Research, international research organizations, and EPRI. The Issue Tracking Table is updated annually
 to reflect the current state of knowledge, and to ensure that the right research is being done at the right time to support LTO decisions.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Participation in the IAEA International Generic Aging Lessons Learned (IGALL) project. EPRI completed a cross-reference assessment of the aging management programs in the IGALL and in EPRI reports to support global implementation of the IGALL; this assessment
 was posted to the IAEA IGALL website.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Worked with DOE LWRS Program to develop a robust database defining the effects of radiation exposure on concrete mechanical properties and initiated a finite element analysis modeling project to quantify the margins of safety for the limiting biological
 shield wall configuration with up to 80 years of radiation exposure.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collaborated with DOE and NRC Research to develop an integrated roadmap of cable R&amp;D projects to inform long-term operations and determine cable remaining useful life. Recent activities focused on harvesting field aged cables, testing methods for submerged
 cables, pursuing advances for condition monitoring technology, and synergistic testing of cables in a high-temperature radiation environment.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Published a research report on screening and testing for reactive concrete aggregates; these results can be used to support decisions regarding aging management of concrete structures susceptible to degradation due to environmental conditions.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collaborated with DOE to design and install a hot cell at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which will be used to demonstrate hybrid laser and friction stir welding processes as repair options for highly irradiated materials. Such technologies could be used
 for repairing reactor vessel internals.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Supported technical meetings with the NRC, Advisory Committee on Reactors Safeguards (ACRS), and NRC Commissioners on EPRI work regarding the technical basis for aging management. Two lead plants in the United States, one PWR and BWR, have expressed their
 intent to submit a second license renewal (SLR) application to the NRC in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.&nbsp;</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Historically, most nuclear power plants have operated as baseload units and have been optimized for continuous full-power operation. This situation is changing for some plants as more renewable generating capacity is brought on-line and as market dynamics
 change.</p>
<p>Flexible operations is defined as any mode of operation that is not baseload. Not all nuclear plants will need to consider flexible operations. Decisions regarding flexible operations are dependent on local grid conditions, contributions from renewables
 and distributed generation, consumer behaviors, and utility fleet economics. Plant owners considering a transition to flexible operations will benefit from technical insights that inform changes in plant operating practices, staff training needs, protocols
 with independent (transmission) system operators, the design and licensing basis, and physical plant modifications.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The dynamics of the grid are changing rapidly due to increasing penetration of renewables, distributed energy, and changing consumer behaviors. These changes may result in a greater need for increased flexibility of dispatchable generation to maintain grid
 reliability. Based on local grid conditions and utility fleet economics, flexible operations of nuclear power plants could become part of a utility fleet management strategy to maintain grid reliability. Flexible operations also may emerge as a new requirement
 for new plant projects; in some countries, the new plants will represent a large load on a small grid and will have to operate flexibly during periods of low demand.</p>
<p>The Flexible Operations Program conducts research to inform decisions regarding flexible nuclear plant operations and characterize associated impacts on plant health and grid reliability. The program collects operating experience on flexible operations,
 supports coordinated research among industry stakeholders, and executes EPRI R&amp;D projects designed to identify and manage potential impacts from flexible operations on the plant and its components.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI is conducting research and development (R&amp;D) to evaluate the impacts of flexible operations on nuclear power plants with respect to fuel integrity, chemistry controls, plant reliability, and other parameters. The research applies to nuclear plants that
 currently need to operate flexibly, to those plants evaluating the need for flexible operations, and to new plants considering flexible operations as a part of their design and licensing basis.</p>
<p>The program accomplishes its goal through an integrated strategy that draws on subject matter experts across the EPRI nuclear sector, incorporates operating experience from EPRI’s Generation sector, and collaborates with the U.S. Department of Energy, International
 Atomic Energy Agency, Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, EDF, and the nuclear steam supply system vendors.</p>
<p>Research activities are grouped into the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operating experience, plant feasibility studies, and readiness reviews</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fuel integrity guidelines</p>
</li><li>
<p>Chemistry, low-level waste and radiation management guidelines</p>
</li><li>
<p>Impacts on balance of plant and flow-accelerated corrosion&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Impacts on primary side components&nbsp;</p>
</li></ul>
<p>EPRI also has initiated a number of research imperatives to drive collaboration on cross-cutting industry priorities. One of these is related to flexible operations: “Enable Cost Effective Flexible Operations in Central Station Generation.” An EPRI team
 is coordinating an integrated, holistic approach using cross-sector resources.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Flexible Operations Program provides broad coordination and collaboration across EPRI’s technical program areas.&nbsp; Key research results include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>An Approach to Transition Nuclear Power Plants to Flexible Operations (3002002612)</em>: This report provides guidance to develop a change management plan for nuclear power plants considering flexible operations options.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Flexible Plant Operations Assessment and Management Matrix</em> (3002004360): Provides a method to systematically identify potential vulnerabilities and management strategies associated with operating at a reduced power level for extended periods of
 time and for implementing flexible operations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Convened an expert panel comprising representatives from the major fuel vendors, INPO and nuclear plant operators to identify knowledge gaps and research needs related to fuel performance and integrity.&nbsp; Recommended updates to operating practices for flexible
 operations are being developed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collected, reviewed and analyzed water chemistry data from both PWRs and BWRs during periods of flexible operations. Trends have been detected in the data and recommendations for increased sampling and monitoring of chemistry condition are being developed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collected, trended and modeled data on crud transport in PWRs during periods of flexible operations. Recommendations based on this data are being developed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Conducted two site visits to collect data on the impacts of flexible operations on the balance of plant.&nbsp; The data has been reviewed and common trends have been detected. This data, in addition to data to be collected from additional site visits, is being
 rolled up into a summary report documenting lessons learned and recommendations.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Flexible Operations Program research for 2017 will focus on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continue sharing operating experience between utility members, vendors and stakeholders on lessons learned and best practices for flexible operations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update the existing gap matrix on flexible operations to identify possible research areas and prioritization of future R&amp;D projects.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Publish guidance to ensure continued fuel integrity during periods of flexible operations.&nbsp; This will take into account ramp rates and duration of power cycles to prevent pellet-clad interaction (PCI) failures during periods of flexible operations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Publish recommended changes to the EPRI PWR and BWR water chemistry guidelines to ensure adequate chemistry controls and monitoring during periods of flexible operations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update EPRI technical reports on crud transport in PWRs and BWRs during periods of flexible operations. Based on the results of ongoing crud transport modeling, develop recommended changes for the primary water chemistry guidelines to maintain fuel integrity
 due to crud related issues.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Continue site visits and data collection on the impact of flexible operations on balance-of-plant components. The results of these site visits will be shared as lessons learned and operating experience reports.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Publish the results of studies with the nuclear steam supply system vendors on the impacts of flexible operations on primary system components. One specific project to be completed in 2017 involves a quantitative assessment of the impact of flexible operations
 on PWR core internals, with recommendations for inspection and monitoring strategies.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p><strong>Key Research Question:</strong> </p>
<p>To better characterize and resolve fuel reliability issues, fundamental understanding of material behavior and properties in as-irradiated conditions is needed, as well as insights into the mechanisms involved during irradiation. A generic, long-term research
 and development program examining these issues can help ensure safe and reliable use of light water reactor (LWR) core materials and components. Since 1982, EPRI has led the Nuclear Fuel Industry Research (NFIR) group, an international collaboration of utilities,
 fuel vendors, and research laboratories. The NFIR program seeks to understand fundamental in-reactor behavior of fuel, cladding, control materials, and other core components and to share this valuable knowledge with the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> </p>
<p>The NFIR program seeks to understand fundamental in-reactor behavior of fuel, cladding, control materials, and other core components, and to share this valuable knowledge with the industry. NFIR performs experimental projects and data interpretation to provide
 a cost-effective source of fundamental fuel performance data. The program takes advantage of the knowledge and expertise of multiple stakeholders and experimental facilities to generate valuable information not obtainable otherwise. Research projects in four
 main areas help address fuel reliability issues: (i) hydrogen pickup mechanisms in zirconium based alloys; (ii) advanced characterization of UO<sub>2
</sub>fuel variants, including separate effects and synchrotron based investigations on fuel fragmentation; (iii) shadow corrosion issues on cladding and core components; and (iv) test reactor irradiations of reference and advanced fuel pellet variants.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The knowledge and data obtained through these projects will be factored into fuel design modifications, new fuel designs, and operational strategies targeting higher fuel reliability. NFIR-VI projects will continue to provide fundamental materials properties
 and behavior data that lead to improved fuel products by improving the knowledge about the behavior of fuel and core components materials. The discussions for NFIR-VII will be initiated with NFIR participants in 2014, and NFIR-VII is expected to launch in
 2016.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The focus in NFIR continues to be on longer-term fundamental R&amp;D that would be beyond the reach of any individual participant.</p>
<p>The NFIR program is conducted in a series of multi-year phases, each containing several research projects. EPRI has launched NFIR-VII in 2016 and in discussions with NFIR members, the R&amp;D topics listed below under Key Activities are to be included in NFIR-VII
 R&amp;D portfolio.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shadow Corrosion in BWRs: Understand the dependence of shadow corrosion on material variables and fuel design.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Mechanistic Studies of Hydrogen Pickup (HPU) in Zirconium Alloys: Investigate material factors that affect HPU.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Hydride Precipitation and Hysteresis Effects in Dry Storage: Confirm whether or not existing hydrides cause an increase in the precipitation temperature and quantify associated precipitation temperature increase.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Effect of [Li] on PWR Corrosion: Identify gaps in current understanding of the effect and conduct a Round Robin of [Li] concentration profile through oxide films using various experimental methods.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Characterizations and Annealing Studies on UO<sub>2 </sub>Fuel Variants: This topic has multiple embedded objective—(a) Develop fuel that is capable of delaying onset of high burn-up structure (HBS) in fuel pellets; (b) Reduce volatile FP release
 and thus reduce propensity of clad failure by pellet-clad interaction stress corrosion cracking (PCI-SCC).; (c) Produce experimental data to model high temperature release of fission gas and volatile fission products from fuel; and (d) Produce data to model
 fuel temperatures at the beginning of life at low burn-ups. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Irradiation of New Fuel Variants for future R&amp;D: Create an inventory of forthcoming fuel variants up to high burn-ups for future PIE, characterizations, and OOP tests.
</li></ul>
<p>Concurrent to discussions and implementation of NFIR-VII, the remaining final deliverable reports of NFIR-VI Projects are being completed in 2017-18. The following long-term irradiation projects from NFIR-VI will also continue into NFIR-VII</p>
<ul>
<li>Irradiation Growth and Thermal Stability of Cold Work and Irradiation Defects in Model Zirconium-based Alloys containing 1% Nb: Pre-hydrided Zr-alloy variants are under irradiation in BOR-60 MTR to pursue irradiation growth, damage annealing, and post-irradiation
 creep </li><li>Impact of hydrogen below and above solubility limits on the irradiation growth of a number of improved channel alloys and reference materials is being examined after exposures in
<strong>A</strong>dvance <strong>T</strong>est <strong>R</strong>eactor (ATR) to different fluence levels up to 30 dpa

<p>Insights into the mechanisms involved during irradiation, and a greater fundamental understanding of material behavior and properties in as-irradiated conditions, are needed to characterize and resolve fuel reliability issues. A generic, long-term research
 and development program examining these issues can help ensure safe and reliable use of light water reactor (LWR) core materials and components. Since 1982, EPRI has led the Nuclear Fuel Industry Research (NFIR) group, an international collaboration of utilities,
 fuel vendors, and research laboratories.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Air and Multimedia Toxics Health and Risk Assessment Program (Air Toxics) provides cutting edge, independent scientific data to inform power companies, their stakeholders, U.S. and international policy makers, and the public of the health risks associated
 with potentially hazardous power plant emissions. The program is regarded by industry and public agencies as a critical and highly respected source of scientific information on air and multimedia toxics. The Air Toxics program focuses on two primary areas
 of research. First, the program conducts basic health science research to address cutting-edge questions on health effects and public health risk assessment of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), including arsenic, mercury, selenium, nickel, chromium, cadmium,
 and trace organics. These comprehensive health effects studies are applicable to all routes of human exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or direct contact), and to the establishment of environmental criteria. Second, working closely with other EPRI programs,
 Program 42 provides the data and tools for assessing the impacts of trace substances both by atmospheric transport and via transfer and transformation in other media. These assessments focus on which routes of exposure are most critical, and quantify the impacts
 likely to result.</p>
<p>With the coal and oil utility industry now fully in compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule, EPRI is undertaking evaluation of the human health risks remaining from the post-MATS industry’s
 emissions. Trace metals and other substances, such as arsenic, may continue to be regarded as posing unacceptable public health risks when post-MATS assessments of “residual,” or remaining, risk are completed. This is particularly the case when multiple emission
 and discharge routes from the power plant are considered. Thus, power companies need to continue investigate whether their emissions may pose risks to public health by all routes of exposure. At the same time, emerging data assessments may be driving health
 standards to more stringent levels, despite uncertainties regarding basic health effects (both cancer and non-cancer). The two trends – tighter health standards combined with the potential for additional reductions being required in HAPs emissions – necessitate
 closer examination of remaining health risks from power industry emissions in the context of all sources of those toxicants.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Air Toxics program focuses on several issues of key importance to power industry operations and planning. As regulatory and operational environments evolve, the program’s research is oriented around emerging issues likely to increase in importance in
 the next several years. The program develops data and methods for assessment of human health impacts, from fundamental health effects studies to regional-scale exposure and health risk assessments. The research conducted in this program benefits all stakeholders
 including the public by providing health information to develop trace substance risk assessments based on sound science and by developing tools to meet any air toxics regulations in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>The program is intended to provide improved estimates of environmental impact. As one example of this, U.S. community exposure to arsenic, whether via water supplies or the atmosphere, typically is much lower than in certain overseas regions in which health
 studies have been conducted and results used to set U.S. regulatory standards for arsenic. EPRI research has focused on biological response at these much lower doses to determine if there is a threshold below which health impacts may not be expected to occur.
 This includes evidence for threshold behavior for both cancer and non-cancer impacts of arsenic.</p>
<p>EPRI development of refined exposure assessment methods has the potential to inform the process on how standards are interpreted by the research community and public agencies. EPRI stack sampling programs in the 1990s (PISCES field sampling) used this exposure
 assessment modeling to refine field protocols and allocate resources by focusing on sampling those substances with significant risk potential. This EPRI multimedia exposure model was cited by a National Academy of Sciences panel as an example of a recommended
 approach to exposure and risk assessment.</p>
<p>One important focus of Program 42 is to inform the power industry about developments in the research community that may impact industry planning. The continuing research on mercury is now focused on analyzing and synthesizing emerging data to determine if
 there are spatial and temporal trends that can be linked to known changes in emissions. This emphasis on source-receptor relationships is a critical yet difficult issue to address for trace substances (such as selenium and arsenic) that have not only natural
 sources, but many human sources as well. The Air Toxics program develops fundamental measurement and modeling methods to distinguish contributions due to utility emissions from other sources.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program integrates basic health science research with risk assessments useful for environmental planning. Basic health research includes controlled laboratory studies and, in some cases, epidemiological studies, as well as an integrated approach to better
 understand the toxicological effects of trace substances. This work is integrated into the development of exposure and risk assessment tools. An essential part of exposure assessment is detailed modeling of the fate of trace substance emissions and the fraction
 that enters ecosystems and waterways.</p>
<p>The research approach is to first evaluate which exposure pathways may result in risk levels of concern and which substances play the greatest role in driving those risks. Those screening results are used to help guide more detailed investigations. Model
 development, and particularly development of methods to evaluate inter-media transfer processes, is an essential part of the process. The goal is to account for the fate, and impact, of these stack emissions (as well as the off-site impacts of other discharge
 pathways, both liquid and solid wastes). Modeling results allow an assessment of the levels of exposure to particular substances by community residents in the vicinity of power plants. Those exposure levels are combined with the substance dose-response relationships
 to calculate human health risks. The work is carried out through site-specific case studies as well as industrywide assessments of environmental impacts. When exposure pathways other than air are demonstrated to play critical roles in exposure, the work cooperates
 closely with those EPRI programs that specialize in surface water, groundwater, and byproduct assessments to provide more exact results. The scientific results from this program are highly applicable to the international community.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Air Toxics program provides distinguished, recognized international expertise in HAPs and multimedia toxics transport, fate, and health impacts. Scientific results are conveyed to federal and state decision-makers as well as international agencies considering
 multinational conventions. The program has an established record of providing research results through open peer-reviewed literature, as well as communication tools focused on key audiences. A key goal of the cooperative research effort is a high multiplier
 effect: significant use of EPRI resources through collaboration with and guidance of joint research efforts. Some recent highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A comprehensive, integrated research program centered on low-dose cancer effects of inorganic arsenic has demonstrated that arsenic exhibits a threshold below which no adverse biological effects – either cancer or non-cancer – would be expected to occur,
 and thus that linear extrapolation from high doses to zero is not appropriate.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Basic health research on chromium(VI) shows that this toxicant does not act via a mutagenic mode of action via ingestion and thus that the shape of the concentration-response curve at low doses is not linear to zero.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Analyses of national mercury databases over a 15-year period showed that no clear pattern of decline in mercury deposition was yet evident at regional or state scales, nor any evidence of east-west differences.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In a regional assessment, linked air and watershed modeling showed that arsenic and selenium added to the system from stack emissions resulted in levels well below health-based water quality criteria.</p>
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>In 2017, the program will continue to focus on characterizing the occurrence and multimedia partitioning of toxic substances in fossil-fuel-fired power plants, especially on evaluating emissions from For 2017 the program is oriented around two primary goals:
 fundamental research results and exposure assessment methods development. Evolution of the power industry due to economic, regulatory, and resource constraints has broadened the scope of studies required. Increasing concern about arsenic, as well as heightened
 regulatory scrutiny, emphasizes the need to focus on its complex dynamics in the environment. Specific efforts will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basic health studies of chromium’s cancer effects in a highly leveraged project.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Studies of arsenic as an air and multimedia toxic of continuing concern, including evidence of arsenic entering the environment from power industry sources via multiple pathways.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Review and analysis of the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program’s toxicological assessments of arsenic and chromium, both of which are expected in 2017.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Development of improved risk assessment tools for evaluation of post-MATS exposures and risk.</p>
</li><li>

<p>Quantifying the exposure-to-health effects relationships of trace metals such as inorganic arsenic and hexavalent chromium continues to be of critical importance to understanding the potential for harm to public health and the environment from current and
 legacy emissions. The need to provide substantive data to aid in scientifically supported environmental and regulatory decision-making remains crucial. Results of ongoing inhalation cancer risk assessments of power generating facilities show that trace metals
 continue to play the major role in calculated risk as power plants change in response to economic and regulatory drivers. By providing improved information to assess the quantitative relationship between health endpoints (cancer and non-cancer) and metals,
 this project helps to resolve the basic uncertainties and critical data gaps vital to informing a range of exposure and risk assessment needs encompassing research programs in air, water, and land.</p>

<p>Mercury is expected to remain an issue for U.S. utilities as long as there are mercury emissions from power plants and levels of mercury in fish are deemed to pose a health risk to consumers. Work underway in 2017 is focused on that very question: whether
 there are significant observable trends in mercury contained in commercial fish, the primary exposure route for U.S. residents. The many emerging streams of data on mercury levels in the atmosphere, in precipitation, waterways, soils, wildlife, and humans
 have to be compared to information on human and natural sources of mercury, and how those are changing over time. Air &amp; Multimedia Toxics program research will continue to investigate whether changes in mercury concentrations in various environmental compartments
 can be linked to decreases in domestic mercury emissions and changes in international emissions. One aspect of this work is investigation of alternative methods to link emissions trends over broad geographic ranges with environmental trends in U.S. and adjacent
 areas.</p>

<p>The studies of risks remaining after MATS compliance, referred to as “residual risk,” will involve assessment of not only health risk via inhalation, but risk via other exposure routes (such as ingestion). As emissions data emerge, EPRI is carrying out a
 series of, first, screening and, then, more detailed inhalation risk assessments focusing on those substances and power plants posing the greatest potential for human health risk. These initial studies are being followed in 2017 by more focused multimedia
 exposure and risk analyses, with the potential for a many-fold increase in potential risk levels over those found for inhalation exposure alone. Application of both the EPA regulatory-application multimedia model and the EPRI TRUE-2 multimedia model allows
 development of uncertainty and variability levels in the resulting risks, as well as sensitivity analyses to determine the most critical factors in deriving risks by particular exposure routes. These determinations, in turn, provide critical information on
 the key uncertainties to help guide process and chemistry studies.</p>

<p>Basic and applied research on methods to better assess human health risks of trace substances have evolved since the development and application of the EPRI TRUE (Total Risk of Utility Emissions) multimedia risk model. In part, the constituent media models
 used for TRUE have been supplanted by more complex models requiring increased computer capabilities. EPRI studies have shown the importance of including longer-term processes in such integrated transport/exposure/risk models; for example, the build-up of substances
 in ecosystems may significantly enhance subsequent concentrations in the human environment. On-going work in several EPRI programs has been addressing trace substance dynamics throughout the environment. Studies in the air, water, and other programs have,
 most recently, focused on mercury and arsenic in the environment, while emphasizing the utility origins of those substances. Additional research is needed to bring together the findings from the various environmental media to model the fate of substances once
 released from power plant sources, and their possible impacts on human health.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Power company operations generate by-products and solid wastes that require engineering and environmental management to prevent contamination of land and groundwater. Historically, coal combustion products (CCPs) have been managed in landfills and ponds,
 or used in a variety of construction and land applications. The current trend in disposal is toward more dry management and landfill disposal of CCPs, and less wet management in ponds. CCP research focuses on accurate characterization of these materials, design
 and operation of landfills, closure of ponds, assessment of legacy sites, health and ecologic risk assessment, groundwater remediation, and environmental assessment of beneficial use applications. Key information needs include evaluating the effects of new
 air emissions controls on management of CCPs, assessing costs and engineering options for compliance with new CCP disposal and use regulations, describing the fate and transport of contaminants, and developing cost-effective strategies to minimize and remediate
 adverse environmental impacts. Increased monitoring of existing and legacy sites as well as intense public scrutiny of CCPs will likely result in the need for more groundwater assessments and corrective actions over the next ten years. This trend will necessitate
 the development of assessment tools and remediation methods tailored to the unique suite of inorganic constituents associated with CCP disposal sites.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Coal Combustion Products - Environmental Issues program provides scientific data, engineering knowledge, restoration methods, models, and other advanced tools and guidance for environmentally protective, cost-effective
 soil and groundwater protection associated with fossil fuel–fired power plants and CCP storage, disposal, and use. Program results provide strong public benefit in providing cost effective and environmentally protective solutions.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Results from this research helps evaluate and develop cost-effective management practices for complying with emerging regulations while ensuring potential risks to the public and environment from disposal and use of CCPs are acceptable. The U.S. power industry,
 for example, currently produces more than 100 million tons of CCPs annually. Annual costs for environmental management of CCPs are expected to increase sharply over the next five to ten years as a result of new disposal regulations. More specifically, research
 in this program helps minimize environmental impacts from CCP management and develop effective state-of-the-science corrective measures where impacts have occurred. It also provides power companies with information and data on environmental performance to
 inform the use of CCPs as a sustainable construction material and other commercial applications. &nbsp;Disposal research benefits the public by supporting improved site performance and effective remediation technologies; beneficial use research advances sustainable
 material management in construction, thereby reducing land area required for disposal, mining and consumption of natural materials, and the overall carbon footprint of construction operations.</p>

<p>The need for environmental assessments at CCP disposal facilities and other power plant sites is expected to grow as CCP ponds are closed, plants are decommissioned, and groundwater monitoring requirements increase. Groundwater assessment costs alone can
 exceed $1 million per site. Scientific data, analysis tools, and models are required to provide a fundamental basis for understanding groundwater flow and transport and the potential for impacting groundwater and surface water resources.</p>
<p>When potential impacts are identified, understanding risks is necessary to determine the need for further action and to select the optimum long-term plan for a site.&nbsp; Publicized releases of either ash or dissolved constituents from CCP management sites have
 significantly heightened public and regulatory interest in environmental risks associated with these facilities.&nbsp;Objective evaluation is needed to delineate real versus perceived risk to potential receptors near these sites, and communication of the actual
 risk posed by a site are critical to ensuring appropriate response actions.</p>
<p>Groundwater typically represents the primary pathway of concern at CCP management sites. This project provides power companies with the latest information and tools to assess and communicate the risks and impacts associated with CCP management sites and
 other power plant facilities. The research results provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools and data developed specifically for assessing the groundwater issues unique to CCP management sites and other power plant facilities
</li><li>Health and ecologic risk assessment methodologies </li><li>Field and laboratory data on chemical transformations and groundwater transport
</li><li>Consistent and well-developed basis for environmental remediation decision-making
</li><li>Improved communications with the public on complex groundwater issues </li></ul>

<p>Management options and environmental assessments for CCPs are driven largely by CCP physical and chemical characteristics. New and changing air emissions controls and advanced generation technologies substantively change the character of the by-products
 generated and their environmental behavior. Air emissions controls that impact fly ash from conventional coal-fired plants include injection of sodium/calcium sorbents for sulfur oxide reduction, injection of activated carbon and other sorbents for mercury
 control, and coal additives such as calcium bromide and cement kiln dust.&nbsp; FGD solids can be impacted by scrubber additives, capture of oxidized mercury, and direct injection of activated carbon into the absorber.&nbsp; FGD wastewater treatment systems for trace
 metals will produce new solid wastes.&nbsp; Fuel blends and biomass coburning can also impact CCP characteristics.</p>
<p>This research provides laboratory and field information on CCP characteristics and how CCPs behave in environmental settings. The results provide core data touching all facets of CCP disposal and use. The information is used to provide technical underpinnings
 for regulation, management strategy, risk assessment, and remediation. The research results:</p>

<p>Power companies generate more than 100 million tons of CCPs every year. About 55% are disposed in landfills or impoundments. In 2015, the US EPA published the CCR Disposal Rule, establishing for the first time federal criteria for location, design, operation,
 and closure of CCR landfills and impoundments.&nbsp; These standards include engineered liners and caps, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, fugitive dust control, stability assessment, corrective action, and posting of site information on a public website.
 These represent new requirements for many facilities, especially at power plants with older CCR impoundments.&nbsp; One significant effect of the rule will be the closing of many CCR impoundments and replacement with new or existing landfills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCR Rule will drive change in disposal site design and operation over the next few years, accelerating the trend away from wet management, and toward engineered landfills and increased beneficial use. The cost to the industry for managing newly produced
 CCPs will exceed a billion dollars per year; costs of managing legacy sites could be much higher. Research under this project will provide power companies with options for complying with new disposal requirements, to improve environmental performance and reduce
 long-term liability in a cost-effective manner. The research will be coordinated with Program 78 research on CCP Use to evaluate environmental performance of use applications. The research results will help to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide information and data on alternatives for compliance with new requirements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Develop cost-effective management and closure options</p>
</li><li>
<p>Control CCP management costs</p>
</li><li>

<p>The need for corrective action at power company sites is expected to grow as new groundwater monitoring requirements are instituted at CCP management facilities (particularly ash ponds) and as older sites are closed. Legacy groundwater impacts will increase
 in importance over the next decade as a result of heightened awareness and changing water quality standards. Groundwater remediation costs can easily exceed $10 million for a single site, and in some cases can be much higher. Retired power plant properties
 also represent liabilities that require some level of site restoration prior to property transactions or development.</p>
<p>Research is needed to provide data on the effectiveness and costs for a range of remediation alternatives, on technologies optimized to work within the framework of the CCR Rule, to tailor existing treatment and remediation methods to power plant sites,
 and to advance evolving technologies.&nbsp; In situ methods, such as chemical injections and permeable reactive barriers, are largely undeveloped for CCP sites, although previous EPRI research has suggested that these technologies have potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project will provide information and tools assist power companies in effectively addressing groundwater remediation and site restoration projects using the latest technologies in this rapidly evolving field. Specific benefits of this research include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remediation methods are evaluated and tailored to address the mix of constituents commonly found in soil and groundwater at power plant sites,</p>
</li><li>
<p>Laboratory and field tests provide basic information and guidelines for developing remediation approaches,</p>
</li><li>
<p>Significant cost savings can be realized with prescreening of available technologies and targeted remediation based on the research results, and</p>
</li><li>
<p>Successful remediations/restorations provide the community with improved water quality and facilitate the productive use of former industrial properties.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Most former manufactured gas plants (MGPs) ceased operation by the 1960s, but by-products and wastes, often disposed of in the plant’s vicinity, still remain and have the potential to cause adverse environmental impacts. More than 3,000 former MGP sites
 exist in the United States and Europe. Many still require either investigation or remediation, at estimated cleanup costs typically in the millions of dollars per site. The wastes include tars (containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]), ammonia and
 cyanide wastes, and oils and petroleum compounds, all of which can contaminate groundwater, soils, and sediments in nearby water bodies. Also, there is the potential for degradation of ambient air during site remediation activities. Indoor air quality in the
 vicinity of these MGP sites may be affected by transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through the soil and into the building. Site managers need credible data and information on alternative investigation and remediation techniques and appropriate site-specific
 cleanup criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI's) <em>Manufactured Gas Plant Site Management program develops cost effective remediation, monitoring, and containment solutions for utilities to reduce the environmental and economic liabilities of highly challenging
 contaminant mixtures residual in MGP legacy sites. </em>Research includes projects that assess site investigation methods and cost-effective alternatives for containment or remediation of contaminated soil, sediment, and groundwater. Program research informs
 regulatory deliberations and helps companies develop and implement cost-effective, environmentally protective management strategies for MGP sites. The program also addresses indoor air quality issues resulting from soil vapor intrusion (SVI) into buildings
 situated near MGP sites.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Remediation and management of former MGP sites is a high-cost and high-liability endeavor. EPRI’s MGP research on rapid and effective MGP site characterization; development and evaluation of technologies for remediation of contaminated soil, sediments, and
 groundwater; and realistic assessment of risk from coal tar/PAH toxicity continues to be invaluable to the MGP community, providing substantial cost savings to individual companies and the industry as a whole. Continuing research, especially on remediation
 of contaminated sediments, demonstrations of alternative remediation technologies, and assessment of SVI/indoor air quality issues, can result in significant cost savings for site management and remediation, as well as reducing the potential for added environmental
 and economic liabilities from these legacy sites.</p>
<p>This research is expected to benefit the public by expediting the assessment and implementation of cleanup projects, more effectively using resources in site remediation projects, and ultimately with lowered electricity rates as more sites are closed and
 redeveloped.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The MGP site management program provides scientific data, methods, and tools for the efficient characterization, assessment, and remediation of former MGP sites. The program helps site owners improve control of emissions/odor issues, evaluates alternative
 methods for remediating and potentially redeveloping MGP sites, and monitors key health risk issues. This program delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique collaborative workshops and industry-wide symposia </li><li>Twenty-five years of EPRI and peer-reviewed publications and documentation and a large network of experts
</li><li>Field studies assessing the viability of SVI investigation methods employing innovative techniques such as microbial genetic methods to metabolize recalcitrant PAHs in soils, forensic chemistry, moisture monitoring, and sorption sampling
</li><li>Modeling techniques such as the Remedial Options Assessment Model (ROAM), used to evaluate MGP site operations and maintenance costs, and the Model for the Assessment and Remediation of Sediments (MARS), used for assessing impacted sediment issues
</li><li>Methods for rapid screening of MGP sites, providing for more cost-effective and thorough site investigations, and
</li><li>Evaluations of site remediation alternatives, including thermal treatment, <em>
in situ</em> chemical oxidation, and smoldering.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This research advances the impacts of state-of-the-art investigation, assessment, and remediation of former MGP sites on soil, sediment, and groundwater. Modeling helps site managers evaluate cleanup alternatives, and the program responds quickly to emergent
 regulatory issues such as SVI and naphthalene risks. The program also assesses alternative site remediation measures, providing clear and issue-specific guidance to site managers on feasible options for meeting individual site requirements. Program accomplishments
 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification and demonstration of alternatives for remediation of MGP-impacted sediments
</li><li>Development of improved PAH analytical methods providing more scientifically accurate measurements in soils and sediments
</li><li>Guidance on MGP-impacted sediment assessment/remediation, including application of bioavailability concepts, monitored natural recovery, and sediment capping
</li><li>Review and identification of improved methods for assessing difficult-to-access areas at MGP sites
</li><li>Continuing evaluation of methods to assess the performance of MGP soils solidification and resources to determine the applicability, implementation, and assessment of soils solidification, and
</li><li>Tracking of PAH toxicity information, including developments in the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) and preparation of comments to the Science Advisory Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Emissions of VOCs and odors can be associated with remediation activities at MGP sites. Monitoring systems are often needed to insure that fence line concentrations of contaminants meet standards. Improved systems for emissions monitoring and for control
 of odor and emissions from the sites may be needed.</p>
<p>In addition, the release of VOCs from soils or groundwater at MGP sites can cause SVI into buildings or can cause odor or VOC emissions during excavation of contaminated soils. These issues are receiving increased regulatory attention through guidance documents
 or permit requirements from regulatory and health agencies. Costly SVI investigations are being required on or near MGP sites. Additional indoor air data collection may be required to reduce uncertainty due to temporal variability in indoor air quality. Subsurface
 depressurization systems are sometimes required in spite of any identified vapor intrusion. Perimeter air monitoring during remediation is also usually required, but uncertainty still exists on how to interpret the data obtained.</p>

<p>Gaining regulatory closure for sites with residual tar contamination can be difficult. Accepted protocols are needed for evaluating residuals and how they behave in the subsurface, particularly their impact on groundwater. Availability of soil contaminants
 by organisms can be significantly less than their gross concentrations. In addition, identification of sources of contaminants can be important in allocating liability for contaminated site cleanups.</p>

<p>Coal tar contains a number of PAHs, exposure to which can be associated with increased probability of cancer incidence. Remediation endpoints for sites contaminated with coal tar are driven by the carcinogenicity of these compounds, which include benzo(a)pyrene
 and naphthalene. Conflicting data on the human carcinogenicity of some of these compounds have led to the development of conservative cleanup criteria. Cleanup levels - that are risk based, are supported by sound science, and are protective of human health
 - may result in a significant reduction in remediation costs.</p>

<p>Remediation of coal tar–contaminated sediments remains an expensive and technically difficult problem for MGP site managers. There is a need to explore alternative remediation strategies such as
<em>in situ</em> remediation and monitored natural recovery. Issues related to cleanup-level requirements remain tied to the toxicity of MGP contaminants to benthic and other aquatic organisms.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>As the electric transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) infrastructure expands and ages, and as new rights-of-way (ROW) standards are developed, power companies need to manage human health risks and minimize environmental impacts from and species interaction
 with power delivery systems to maintain safe and reliable grid operation. System components, such as service centers, substations, and cables, face issues related to spills, runoff, and cleanups, and life-cycle decision making is a critical route to improved
 environmental performance. Environmentally acceptable options are needed for selecting and managing utility poles and dielectric fluids, designing facilities, and remediating contamination. Efficient, cost-effective ROW vegetation management and transmission
 line siting are increasingly important for compliance with new reliability standards. In addition, power companies need to reduce avian interactions with generation and T&amp;D facilities and protect sensitive species and habitats during ROW construction and maintenance,
 while recognizing opportunities to optimize ecological assets on new and existing ROWs.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI’s) T&amp;D and ROW Environmental Issues program delivers information, tools, and methods for preventing, characterizing, and remediating soil and water contamination at T&amp;D facilities, as well as for designing and
 retrofitting T&amp;D facilities. Data and products from the program support information needs for scientifically sound regulations and cleanup standards for chemicals associated with T&amp;D and ROW facilities and operations, as well as providing engineering, science,
 and business tools to aid in their management. The program also provides balanced, cost-effective solutions for addressing the economic and environmental challenges of siting, developing, managing, and upgrading T&amp;D ROWs whether above or below ground. Innovative
 tools, practical guidance, and state-of-the-art information help companies control ROW costs and improve service reliability while protecting natural resources and addressing public, regulatory, and other stakeholder concerns.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Program research has documented savings of $10 million per year industrywide for used oil management, $1.5 billion per year for management of creosote and pentachlorophenol utility poles as nonhazardous waste, and $500,000 at a single site by demonstration
 of the true risk of a mineral oil spill. The program also helped save one company $1 million in spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (SPCC) regulatory compliance costs. Program research also expedites transmission line siting and ensures system reliability
 by addressing ecological issues associated with vegetation management standards, reducing ROW maintenance costs, and enhancing ecological value through Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM). The program also improves a utility’s ability to assess and prevent
 bird strike impacts, enhances ecosystems along T&amp;D ROWs, and provides materials to help companies communicate with regulators and address public concerns. This program provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific information and data to help power companies make optimal decisions on T&amp;D ROW equipment choices and remedial approaches
</li><li>Characterization information on substances related to environmental and human health risk, and strategies to reduce financial risk and operations and management costs
</li><li>Constructive engagement on federal oversight of transmission vegetation management, and information for regulatory development
</li><li>Opportunities for proactive environmental management to decrease potential for outages and fines, and shorter time frames for siting new transmission lines
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program addresses environmental challenges at substations, service centers, and T&amp;D ROWs with options assessment, fate and transport studies, and remedial approaches. It facilitates communications with stakeholders through data and life-cycle studies,
 and examines a growing societal focus on sustainability by looking at issues such as the large resource represented by out-of-service utility poles. The program conducts field studies, best-practice surveys, risk assessments, workshops, and technology development
 and demonstration projects. This program is closely coordinated with EPRI’s Power Delivery &amp; Utilization (PDU) research in delivering collaborative environmental science- and engineering-based solutions to environmental T&amp;D challenges. This program delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools to cost-effectively manage legacy polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and research to inform PCB remediation activities;
</li><li>Software tools for advanced spill simulation to examine environmental impacts of leaks such as oil spills and to support discussions with regulators;
</li><li>Technology evaluations for alternate transformer oil containment; </li><li>Pilot tests to expand remediation options for spills and leaching of substances such as arsenic;
</li><li>Environmental risk management decision tools that assist&nbsp;in the prioritization of equipment inspection and replacement needs;
</li><li>Collaboration with other industry groups such as the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee, International Society of Arboriculture, Utility Arborists Association, and government agencies;
</li><li>Continuing support for the international symposia on environmental concerns in ROW management;
</li><li>Integrated vegetation management (IVM) field assessments of transmission vegetation management practices to aid utilities in reducing vegetation management costs while addressing environmental and sustainability goals;
</li><li>Long-term vegetation management field studies to reduce vegetation management costs and address issues identified during IVM field assessments;
</li><li>Field manipulative studies to support observational and retrospective studies spanning one to three years to evaluate vegetation management practices to promote pollinators, and
</li><li>Development of innovative tools to reduce avian and other animal interactions at utility facilities.
</li></ul>
<p>The technical results of this program are highly relevant to international utilities and other stakeholders.&nbsp; The focus of the program work is T&amp;D ROW, however any ROW large enough to impact or be impacted by the biodiversity and vegetation would benefit
 e.g. gas pipeline construction, underground utility construction, telecom ROW, Wind Farm ROWs.</p>

<p>Birds and other wildlife interact with power structures in many ways. Some structures (towers, poles, and stacks) and associated ROW habitats can provide favorable sites for bird nesting, roosting, and foraging and for hunting activities for a wide variety
 of bird and other animal species, without affecting operations. At the same time, birds are at risk from potential interactions with these structures, including collisions with wires and towers, and birds and other wildlife can be subject to electrocution
 (transformers, conductor configurations).</p>

<p>All ROWs are managed with the general goal of providing safe and reliable transport of electricity. ROW managers strive to meet these goals by developing low-growing vegetation that persists over the long term. For most ROW managers, active management is
 required to create desired vegetation and related environmental conditions. ROW vegetation management represents a major cost for the industry, with individual company costs in the range of $5–$20 million per year.</p>

<p>Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-containing dielectric fluids were used extensively in electrical equipment until their use was banned in the late 1970s. Utility companies are continuing to remove legacy equipment that contains PCBs. This equipment can be
 difficult to identify, so strategies for identification and removal are needed.&nbsp; In addition, PCBs were incorporated into a wide range of industrial materials and consumer products, including paints, caulks, mastic, wire insulation, and lubricants.&nbsp; Due to
 their chemical stability, PCBs are still found in these materials and in the environment decades after their initial use.</p>

<p>Poles are a huge and valuable asset of a utility company. Companies need to manage poles across the pole life cycle with practices that ensure engineering performance, manage costs, and protect the environment and human health. This process begins with selection
 of the optimal pole for each setting, continues through careful use, and ends with final disposition that recognizes the asset value and minimizes ongoing risk.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Water Quality and Watershed Protection Program provides scientific information and tools to characterize the risks of wastewater discharges and non-point sources of pollution; help power companies meet permit requirements; and assist stakeholders,
 regulatory agencies, and policy makers in managing aquatic resources to benefit water quality, aquatic communities, wildlife, and human health.</p>
<p>Electric power facilities generate wastewater that can contain metals, additional dissolved constituents, and suspended solids and, in combination with other point and non-point sources of pollution, may contribute to aquatic and human health risks. Reducing
 scientific uncertainties and reliance on default assumptions in risk assessments is essential to ensure cost-effective and environmentally protective compliance strategies, as well as to inform permitting, regulatory, and resource management decisions.</p>
<p>How power companies manage, treat, and discharge wastewater will be continually influenced by community pressures and diverse regulatory requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Water Quality Criteria</strong>: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to review all ambient water quality criteria for possible revision over the next five to ten years.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Air Quality Regulations</strong>: As regulations are adopted for ozone, particulate matter, SO<sub>2</sub>, NOx, and hazardous air pollutants, new fuels and environmental control technologies may influence the characteristics of power plant wastewaters,
 as well as nonpoint sources of pollution (i.e., atmospheric deposition, runoff, etc).</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA</strong>): The SDWA establishes Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for compounds such as arsenic that can be captured by environmental control systems and thus found in wastewater.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>State Rules and Permits</strong>: States issue discharge permits to meet EPA guidelines, but always have the option of adopting stricter limits for individual waste water discharges in response to community concerns or site-specific conditions. Some
 states are beginning to address storm water discharges and their effect on aquatic life. At least one state has established numeric water quality criteria for stormwater.</p>
</li><li><strong>Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Management</strong>: Increasingly, TMDLs are being applied to manage point and nonpoint source pollution through watershed-wide planning initiatives that create opportunities for water quality trading.
</li></ul>
<p>The Water Quality and Watershed Protection Program advances scientific knowledge and develops methods and tools to mitigate the risks associated with power plant discharges of mercury, arsenic, selenium, nitrogen, and other compounds into aqueous environments.
 The program helps industry, regulators, and other stakeholders develop and implement cost-efficient strategies for watershed protection. It delivers advanced analytical and modeling techniques to allow site-specific conditions and new understanding of environmental
 behavior and dose-response relationships to be incorporated in regulatory and permitting processes. It also expands the knowledge base and available options for addressing mercury and nitrogen emissions, developing and meeting TMDL requirements, and implementing
 watershed management strategies.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI brings a comprehensive approach to water quality management and watershed protection, accounting for multimedia emissions from power plants, the impact of new environmental control systems on wastewater discharges, and the contributions of other point
 and non-point sources. The research provides scientific, risk-based information and tools for use by members, regulators, and other stakeholders in developing permit limits, regulations, standards, TMDLs, and management plans addressing human health, aquatic
 toxicity, eutrophication, and other issues.</p>
<p>By helping reduce reliance on assumptions that may not accurately estimate risks, the program supports economically and ecologically sound decision-making. The public perceives that watershed and ecosystem protection can be costly and burdensome. With well-considered
 actions reflecting sound science and risk-based decision-making, sustainable water resource management goals can be achieved, and in turn benefit the public by helping to manage or ensure lower electricity costs. When applied appropriately, EPRI’s knowledge
 base, tools, and recommended technologies can also assist power producers in meeting environmental quality objectives in a resource-efficient manner.</p>
<p>The research conducted in this program benefits all stakeholders, including the public, by providing information on the risk to human health and the environment from wastewater discharges to aquatic environments from power generation facilities including
 natural gas facilities and solar thermal generation as well. The program also develops modeling tools to explain the fate and transport of these discharges to inform regulatory developments. The scientific results and tools developed in this program are highly
 applicable to international utilities.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI research addresses current priorities and emerging issues, including risk-based management of mercury, arsenic, selenium, nitrogen, and other contaminants on a site-specific and watershed-wide basis; implementation of best management practices and advanced
 analytical methods; and effects of environmental control equipment, such as scrubbers on power plant discharges and receiving waters. The program also examines concerns not yet widely recognized, such as how changing wastewater discharge characteristics may
 affect threatened or endangered species. This program delivers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When updated selenium ambient water quality criteria are published, EPRI will develop a guidance document on developing site-specific criteria protocols for compliance with new selenium limits;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Research on mercury to enhance understanding of its cycling in aqueous environments, speciation and bioaccumulation, and health impacts and to develop site-specific compliance criteria protocols;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Presentations to state and federal decision makers and other stakeholders considering the fate and transport of mercury and other constituents in aqueous environments;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Evaluation of non-cancer effects of concern for arsenic;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Development of an arsenic multimedia fate, transport, and health risk screening model;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Information for watershed and TMDL regulatory compliance and management decisions on mercury, nitrogen, ammonia and other nutrients, metals, and sediments;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Water quality trading and ecosystem services approaches to reduce environmental impacts of nutrient runoff and costs of permit requirements&nbsp;; and</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collaborative work with other EPRI programs in areas such as atmospheric deposition, effluent characteristics, and the effects of weather patterns on water availability and quality.</p>
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Engaging domain experts, collaborating with and providing technical assistance to regulatory and other agencies, and developing peer-reviewed literature are critical to informing the development of cost-effective and protective regulations and permit conditions.
 Applications of program results have produced documented site-specific compliance cost savings ranging from tens of thousands of dollars up to more than $10 million. Program accomplishments include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research results supported ambient water quality criteria for arsenic at state and federal levels;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Research increased the understanding of the fate of mercury in the environment and helped place power plant emissions in a global context, informing policy and regulatory dialogues;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Members, federal agencies, and state agencies use the Dynamic Mercury Cycling Model (D-MCM) to examine and predict sources of mercury and mercury bioaccumulation in aqueous environments;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Members use the methylmercury guidance document to guide sampling and modeling to inform regulatory decisions; and</p>
</li><li>
<p>EPRI established a trading framework and functioning market for the world’s largest water quality trading program for market-based nutrient reduction.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) develops national ambient water quality criteria, which are then implemented by the states. Power companies are subject to limits on metals and other pollutants in their waste water discharge permits based
 on existing criteria, and also on new criteria, as those are developed and implemented. There is a need for improved methods for the development of water quality criteria to ensure that the criteria reflect the latest science. Over the long term, there is
 a need for development of modeling approaches that describe more accurately the risk to aquatic life and human health from the release of metals and other pollutants to surface waters.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Mercury Cycling (D-MCM) Model is such an approach. The D-MCM is a Windows™ based simulation model for personal computers. It predicts the cycling and fate of three major forms of mercury (methylmercury, inorganic Hg(II), and elemental mercury)
 in aquatic systems, including lakes, rivers, wetlands and marine systems. D-MCM is a time-dependent mechanistic model, designed to consider the most important physical, chemical and biological factors affecting fish mercury concentrations. The model is set
 up to run both deterministically and probabilistically, the latter using a Monte-Carlo approach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another approach, which is under development, is the Multi-ion Toxicity (MIT) Model, which is being development with close cooperation with the EPA. This model is a possible replacement for the EPA aquatic life conductivity benchmark of 300 ?S/cm. This conductivity
 level is expected to be technologically difficult and costly to achieve. In addition, the conductivity approach does not provide an indication of water composition, information that may be needed to accurately assess the potential for multi-ion toxicity to
 result at a given conductivity level. Several benefits will be realized, if a technically defensible assessment approach for MIT is achieved. First, it will provide a quantitative basis for evaluating levels of major ion mixtures in surface waters that are
 consistent with the intended level of protection to be provided by water quality criteria. It will also serve to limit the needless expenditure of resources to achieve improved treatment levels that may not yield meaningful environmental benefit, and to focus
 resources on those settings where more advanced levels of treatment may be warranted.&nbsp; In short, it will provide an improved basis for making an informed decision regarding the most efficient way to allocate limited resources to achieve improvements in environmental
 quality.</p>

<p>The association between environmental inorganic arsenic exposure and cancer health effects such as that of skin, lung, and bladder is well known. &nbsp;<em>In vitro</em> genomic responses to arsenic in human lung and bladder cells may reveal relative similarities
 in response across human target tissues. &nbsp;Cancer risk has been the driver of understanding the potential for health effects following exposure for arsenic health risk estimation, with linear extrapolation default methods employed by the U.S. Environmental
 Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).</p>
<p>Revisions to the U.S. EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) process, however, may result in new non-cancer endpoint(s) of concern that have not been the focus in past arsenic non-cancer health risk evaluations.&nbsp; A review of recent studies that
 have linked arsenic exposure to an exceedingly wide range of non-cancer health endpoints (including dermatological, developmental, neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, immunological and endocrine effects) is necessary to evaluate the likely non-cancer
 endpoint(s) of concern. &nbsp;Critical review is essential to identify strengths and limitations of these studies, as well as data gaps. &nbsp;Assessment of arsenic-related genomic responses already available for human cells may reveal information relevant to non-cancer
 endpoints as well. &nbsp;Results will be integrated into a new, comprehensive, science-based non-cancer risk framework for arsenic that may then be applied to future regulatory revisions of the arsenic ambient water quality criteria. &nbsp;This work will be coordinated
 with the Program 42 Air and Multimedia Toxics Health and Risk Assessment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A principal strategic United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) objective is to use a watershed approach through the implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) and watershed-integrated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
 permits to achieve protection of water resources. This approach creates a growing number of new, complex research needs. Research is needed to address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how&nbsp;to effectively manage storm water runoff; </li><li>Couple&nbsp;watershed and air quality models to address TMDLs where atmospheric&nbsp;deposition is a major source of pollutants (such as nitrogen, acidity, mercury, selenium, and arsenic);
</li><li>Derive, allocate, and implement complex TMDLs (involving, for example, selenium,&nbsp;and arsenic impacts); and
</li><li>Understand&nbsp;technical basis of impairment listing processes. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;It is important to be aware that TMDLs can supersede NPDES permits, resulting in more restrictive discharge allowances.</p>

<p>Water quality trading is one of several United States Environment Protection Agency (EPA)-approved market-based approaches for addressing complex environmental issues. This project will continue work to establish water quality trading as a business-appropriate,
 cost-effective, and ecologically defensible option for the electric power and other sectors in complying with increasingly stringent permit limits and in-stream water quality standards. Building on EPRI’s Ohio River Basin Trading Program, now the largest water
 quality trading program in the world, EPRI will identify lessons learned, opportunities, hurdles, and optimizations that can be applied to any program in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI’s) Fish Protection at Electric Generating Facilities Program provides tools, technologies and analyses for power plants (steam electric, hydropower, pumped storage, and marine and hydrokinetic) to cost effectively
 protect aquatic communities in accordance with U.S. and international fish protection requirements.</p>
<p>A primary challenge for power plant owners is to ensure adequate water supplies for operations while protecting aquatic life in the lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans those operations impact. In the United States, the Clean Water Act §316(b) requires
 plant owners to install fish protection technologies on cooling water intake structures, while §316(a) requires management of thermal discharges. Section 316 compliance is regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program
 with national regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates hydropower projects for investor owned and state facilities, and federal facilities (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
 and Bureau of Reclamation) are regulated under the National Environmental Policy Act. In 2014, final §316(b) regulations for existing steam electric facilities with once-through cooling were issued, which require installation of cooling water intake fish protection
 technologies and possible retrofit of cooling towers. Plant owners are also required to perform numerous studies to support determination of Best Technology Available (BTA) for reducing impingement and entrainment. In addition, facilities are seeing increasingly
 stricter permit requirements limiting their thermal discharges to prevent aquatic impacts. The outcome of the regulatory process will impose significant costs on the power industry, and the need for cost-effective fish protection technologies will be a critical
 element of future research to identify and test appropriate technologies. Additional research will be needed to support members and resource agencies as they conduct required monitoring studies.</p>
<p>EPRI’s fish protection program assesses the effects of power plant cooling system operation on fish and other aquatic life. Results support the development of effective intake and discharge protection approaches for workable operating permits at individual
 facilities. By improving the technical basis for regulatory, permitting, and operating decisions, this program serves the public interest in effective resource management while meeting industry-wide imperatives to control costs, ensure or exceed environmental
 compliance requirements, manage business risks, and provide affordable electricity.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI performs extensive research on fish protection technologies for cooling water intake structures and waterpower (conventional hydropower, pumped storage, and marine and hydrokinetic) projects and procedures for assessing impacts on aquatic communities.
 The research has demonstrated the site-specific nature of aquatic impacts, the efficacy of various technologies for different fish and shellfish species, improvements to technologies to enhance survival rates, and technology costs and value of the benefits
 achieved. This program helps environmental compliance managers and power plant operators effectively manage water resources and protect aquatic communities in accordance with fish protection regulations. Program information may reduce compliance costs, enhance
 permitting processes, and identify cost-effective management strategies. The research supports the development of aquatic life protection approaches for cost-effective operating permits at individual facilities. It also provides access to new and enhanced
 fish passage and protection technologies, information on fish protection–related issues, and information on cost, economic, environmental, and electric system impacts of compliance and licensing/relicensing requirements. The public will benefit from minimized
 impacts to aquatic environments, cost-effective compliance, and license/relicensing strategies that will have minimal impact on electricity rates.</p>
<p>EPRI fish protection R&amp;D identifies and evaluates technologies for improved fish passage and protection, informs all stakeholders in the permitting and licensing process with sound technical information, and provides technical information for cost-effective
 environmental compliance that contributes to affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity. The technical results and tools developed in this program are strongly applicable to international utilities.</p>

<p>Around the world, power plant and other industrial operations with cooling water intake structures (CWIS) are increasingly seeing regulatory requirements to reduce mortality to fish and shellfish caused by impingement and entrainment (I&amp;E). In 2014 the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued final Clean Water Act §316 regulations (Rule) to control I&amp;E at existing facilities and new units at existing facilities with once-through cooling. Compliance with regulations requires sampling of fish and shellfish
 in the aquatic environment in the vicinity of cooling water intakes and discharges, as well as from intake structures and within power plant cooling water systems. Water body type (for example, lake, reservoir, estuary, and river), power plant cooling system
 configuration and operation, and intake fish protection technology all present site-specific challenges to collecting representative sample data. The health of impinged and entrained fish before their contact with power plant systems can also compromise the
 interpretation of sample results and fish protection technology performance. The final Rule requires several applicant studies related to characterizing impingement and entrainment, assessing the economic benefit of alternative fish protection technologies
 as well as many future technology performance monitoring studies, which will be a challenge for permit applicants and permit authorities and may raise questions from the public at large. The new regulation also requires consideration of potential impacts to
 rare, threatened and endangered species. This project will provide the requisite learning to assist permit applicants, resource agencies and regulators, and the public in conducting technically sound sampling programs and economic benefit analyses and interpreting
 the results.</p>

<p>Identification of cost-effective fish protection technologies for installation at cooling water intake structures to control impingement and entrainment of fish and shellfish is a primary goal of industry in seeking to comply with the Clean Water Act §316(b)
 New and Existing Facility rules. EPA promulgated a final Rule for existing facilities in 2014. The Rule requires power plants with design intake flows exceeding 2 million gallons per day (MGD) to reduce impingement mortality via one of several options, including
 reducing cooling water intake structure design through-screen velocity to less than 0.5 feet per second (fps), meeting an impingement mortality performance standard, optimizing the performance of fish-friendly traveling water screens and fish return systems
 or demonstrating that impingement occurs at extremely low levels. EPA identified modified (&quot;fish-friendly&quot;) traveling water screens with a maximum open dimension equivalent to a 3/8-inch square mesh and fish return systems as Best Technology Available (BTA)
 for meeting the impingement mortality standard. Facilities with design intake flows exceeding 2 MGD are also subject to reducing entrainment mortality; however, only facilities withdrawing more than 125 MGD actual intake flow must submit a Comprehensive Entrainment
 Characterization Study, evaluate entrainment reduction technologies (including closed-cycle cooling and fine-mesh screens), and evaluate their environmental impacts and benefits (nine specific factors must be evaluated). Entrainment compliance is determined
 by the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis and could result in a determination ranging from the existing cooling water intake structure being deemed BTA to a requirement to retrofit closed-cycle cooling.</p>

<p>As a result of recent extended droughts in many regions, increased societal demands for water withdrawals, continued concern about protection of aquatic biota, and growing demand for more electric power, there is renewed interest in the management and consequences
 of thermal discharges. Once through cooling, steam electric plants discharge waters at elevated temperatures into nearby surface waters. These waters can potentially have adverse effects on fish and macroinvertebrates. Key questions regarding these discharges
 include:&nbsp;protection of endangered and threatened species, differences between field observations and laboratory measurements of fish responses; interaction of thermal discharge issues with other issues such as §316(b); Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), NPDES
 permits; interactions of thermal discharges with other pollutants; and macroinvertebrate responses.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s “Water Availability and Resource Risk Management Program” develops state of the art tools and analyses for power companies to address water resource planning needs in addition to other resource management requirements.</p>
<p>Power and other industry operations, equity, and financing are threatened by constraints on water and other natural resources. Cultural resources, ecosystem health, biodiversity and ecosystem services are examples of other resources of concern to industry
 and the general public. Several factors are focusing more attention on water availability/use and are putting pressure on the power industry and other sectors to increase water use efficiency and minimize overall water consumption and withdrawal. These factors
 include population increases coupled with regional population shifts, competing demands among all water users, climate variation, and aquatic ecosystem protection. This scrutiny has significant implications for electricity generation and transmission operations
 and growth, including power plant siting and water resource resiliency. If existing power plants cannot access sufficient water for cooling or other needs, power companies may be forced to reduce power output or shut down plants, and siting and construction
 of new assets may be stalled. The same types of operating and growth impacts could impact other commercial operations in different sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI's) Water Availability and Resource Risk Management Program develops tools, knowledge, and data that power companies and other stakeholders need to understand the perspectives of all water resource stakeholders,
 participate in evolving Energy/Water/Food Nexus development, build resilience strategies for a natural resource–constrained future, and address questions raised by lending institutions and investors concerning potential resource–based limitations on business
 operations and growth. Research focuses on developing and evaluating integrated resource risk management and forecasting tools, developing and testing metrics to measure resource management outcomes, assessing use, cost and benefits of nontraditional water
 resources, understanding cross-media phenomena impacts on resources, learning fundamental principles of ecosystem management and protection, and mitigating impacts of resource limitations on operations.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Water resource sustainability and resource stewardship are receiving increased interest from many constituencies. Examples include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA’s) Office of Water requested the Science Advisory Board to provide consultation on the data, information, and analytical methodology needed to evaluate the value of water to the U.S. economy and provide a resource
 for future decision making</p>
</li><li>
<p>Financial institutions, stakeholders, and stockholders are requesting that utilities and other companies develop water use (water stewardship) data and water resource resiliency plans as driven by the ongoing discussions of the energy/water nexus by the
 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The Program’s research develops and implements cost-efficient, risk-based strategies for improved power plant water use efficiency, reduced power plant water demand, and management of increasing climate variability impacts on utility operations. Research
 is also applicable to other commercial operations and water use sectors. The focus is on development and evaluation of resource management and forecasting tools, development and testing of integrated engineering/economic risk management plans, development
 and enhancement of nontraditional water sources, creation and tests of water management metrics, and identification of resource conservation opportunities. Whether used domestically or in an international setting, these research results can promote more-effective
 plans for managing water and other critical resources. This research will help power companies site future thermal generation facilities as well as consider location of other generation sources such as renewable technologies. The same tools can be used to
 support development and operations of other commercial activities. The public will benefit from such proactive planning measures and could see considerable savings in the cost of electricity and improved protection of the environment and ecosystem services
 over time through active management of water and other resources.</p>
<p>The economic and social vitality of a community is dependent on its ability to meet both its water and energy needs. This Program provides knowledge and tools to assist all segments of the community to prudently manage community water resources. The Program
 also delivers, to federal, state and local agencies, data and tools to support effective, cost efficient natural resource risk management. The technical results produced in this program are broadly applicable to international utilities and stakeholders.</p>

<p>The program will complete studies on evaluating alternative sources of water and analyzing the economics of watershed management strategies to protect water and other resources. Based upon member prioritization of proposed studies and available funding,
 The program will initiate studies on water resource resiliency planning, testing previously developed water management metrics, evaluating costs of water conservation strategies and technologies, evaluating market-based approaches to water resource management,
 assessing effects of wet/dry weather cycles on the electric power sector, conducting a national forecasting analysis of water consumption across all water using sectors, linking and testing cross-media ecological effects models, and evaluating regulatory and
 business impetus for water resource conservation measures and ecosystem service assessments. This program's research is an integral component of EPRI's cross-sector water research, which includes demonstrations and pilots of emerging technologies and proof-of-concept
 studies of novel technologies to reduce power plant freshwater use and reduce the cost of treating and transporting water and wastewater. The Water Availability and Resource Risk Management program evaluates the efficacy of these different technologies to
 meet community and regional electric power/water resource sustainability needs.</p>

<p>Rapidly growing demand for clean, fresh water, coupled with the need to protect and enhance the environment, have made many regions vulnerable to water shortages. Such shortages could cause reductions in current supplies of electricity and could have direct
 impacts on power system planning and expansion.&nbsp; These shortages can also impact other water-use sectors and have a negative impact on the environment.&nbsp; Climate variability is also increasing the impact on water resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;Water and energy shortages can
 occur relatively suddenly and can have adverse impacts on local and regional economies. To address this critical issue, research needs include creation and demonstration of decision-support tools for watershed management and power plant water use, development
 of water resource knowledge bases, and integrated resiliency assessments of regional power and water supplies.</p>

<p>The economic health of the power sector and society at large can be impacted by resource constraints of which water is only one. In addition, properties owned by power companies can contain valuable natural resources whose protection can result in financial
 gains and losses to the owners. Multiple approaches and concepts, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed as natural resource management tools, such as ecosystem management, natural resource stewardship, environmental assessment, and ecosystem
 services. Federal and state resource management and environmental protection agencies are actively studying the application of these different approaches and constructs. This key questions the project addresses focus on how resources the power sector owns
 and utilizes can be managed cost effectively and perhaps with revenue production.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI’s) Effluent Guidelines and Water Quality Management Program is the focal point for electric power industry wastewater characterization data and analyses to scientifically inform regulatory guidelines for effluents.
 The program supports plant wastewater management needs and conducts data analysis into cost and performance of treatment options.</p>
<p>Research in this program provided the basis for informing the rulemaking process to revise effluent guidelines for wastewater discharges into surface waters at existing steam electric power plants. In September 2013, EPRI submitted public comments to the
 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the proposed guideline revisions regarding the costs and expected pollutant removals for various treatment technologies as applied to effluents of concern. The 2015 final rule set numeric limits on wastewater from
 FGD systems and restricted the discharge of transport waters for fly ash and bottom ash. The final rule did incorporate some revisions to the numeric limits for selenium, mercury, arsenic, and nitrate/nitrite in flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater as
 well as allowed flexibility with the use of bottom ash transport water for FGD make-up.&nbsp;In parallel, some U.S. states and regions are considering low parts-per-trillion limits for mercury and other metals</p>
<p>The program supports FGD and other wastewater treatment operations by evaluating and assisting in the development of online, real-time water quality monitors to assist wastewater treatment operation and effluent monitoring. The program also develops sound
 guidelines for effective management of low-volume, non-ash wastewater streams and conducts studies to accurately characterize industry water management practices. As the rulemaking process progresses additional opportunities for input may emerge. This program
 will continue to review and analyze any additional data to more broadly characterize trace elements in power plant wastewater steams, to evaluate the overall performance and costs for wastewater treatment options for trace metals and nutrients, as well as
 overall plant wastewater management options.</p>
<p>The research in this program is coordinated with EPRI’s Water Management Technology program.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Program research helps inform the regulatory process and provides information to facility owners to manage the effluent guideline revisions as well as develop wastewater management strategies. As water discharge permit limits for trace metals and nutrients
 tighten, power companies need accurate analytical methods and online, real-time water quality monitors, reliable data, and independent performance and cost data for plant wastewater management. In addition, as power plants install air pollution control technologies
 to meet the hazardous air pollutant standards, these technologies—such as bromide addition, mercury re-emission chemicals or dry sorbent injection e.g. trona—may also impact wastewater and its treatability. Science-based analyses and extrapolation of the data
 will be necessary to help inform various stakeholders, including regulatory agencies, industry, and the public – as well as assist power plants manage plant wastewater. Key motivations for this research include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best scientific data available are needed for informing the continued rulemaking as well as assisting power plants with compliance and wastewater management. This includes characterization and treatability analysis for all possible plant design, operating
 conditions and coal properties expected across the existing fleet. </li><li>Accurate and adequately sensitive analytical methods including online, real-time water quality monitors are needed to assist in water treatment operations and to reduce the likelihood of permit violations to avoid false permit violations, and to decrease
 capital and operating/maintenance costs for wastewater treatment. </li><li>Evaluation of the cross-media impacts of air pollution control technologies on wastewater discharges is needed to assure compliance capability.
</li><li>Data are needed to assist in managing bottom ash transport water in closed loop bottom ash transport systems.
</li></ul>
<p>The program’s research will ultimately benefit all stakeholders, including the public, by minimizing adverse impacts to the environment as well as minimizing the overall costs of managing wastewaters from electric power generating facilities.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI characterizes power plant waters, evaluates and develops analytical methods and water quality monitors, and independently evaluates the overall performance and costs for various wastewater management options. Program results are communicated through
 briefings for key stakeholders, including regulatory and other government agencies; reports; presentation materials; information summaries for public consumption; and service on various advisory panels. This program delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online, real-time water quality monitors to assist in wastewater treatment operations and compliance
</li><li>Summary evaluation of industry-wide wastewater treatment capital and operating and maintenance costs, as well as general overall treatment performance
</li><li>Wastewater management strategies to assist in compliance with existing or revised discharge permits
</li><li>Industry-specific data and information and scientifically-sound data assessment that helps determine the basis for informing the rulemaking as well as assisting power plants manage their wastewater
</li><li>Guidance in managing bottom ash transport waters, specifically closed-loop systems without a discharge
</li><li>Guidance in managing low-volume plant wastewaters </li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program's research informs industry, regulators, the public and other stakeholders about potential discharge limits and feasibility of treatment technologies as they relate to effluent guideline revisions. Program information has also been useful to
 power companies that install new FGD systems, negotiate new wastewater discharge permits, and plan wastewater treatment and management options. Program accomplishments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characterization of FGD wastewater treatment influent and effluent for trace metals and nitrates/nitrites,
</li><li>Laboratory treatment studies to optimize trace metals removal in FGD physical/chemical systems,
</li><li>Development of cost estimation approaches for FGD wastewater treatment, including physical/chemical, biological, and thermal zero liquid discharge (ZLD),
</li><li>Laboratory evaluation of selenium chemistry in wet FGD systems, </li><li>Characterization of selenium and mercury in FGD waters and its potential treatment implications,
</li><li>Comments to the EPA on the proposed effluent guidelines revisions, as well as the draft and revised permits for Public Service of New Hampshire Merrimack station,
</li><li>Characterization data and predictive tools for estimating trace metals in ash pond wastewater,
</li><li>Guidelines for plant process wastewater management of total suspended solids, pH, and trace metals,
</li><li>Engineering studies to evaluate the conversion from wet to dry bottom ash handling systems
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Program R&amp;D for 2017 will continue to focus on mercury, selenium, arsenic, and nitrate/nitrite water characterization, for which EPA has finalized new standards for FGD wastewater. As power plants install air pollution control technologies such as bromide
 addition, mercury re-emission chemicals, or trona injection, these technologies may impact FGD and ash pond wastewater and its treatability for key trace metals such as mercury and selenium. Such technologies may also have possible downstream impacts such
 as the potential to form trihalomethanes (THMs). Specifically, the research will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue support of stakeholders in informing the ongoing effluent guidelines rulemaking, including synthesis analyses of data from EPA and others to support the rulemaking and other available data, as well as conduct studies to accurately characterize
 industry wastewater management practices </li><li>Provide accurate and reliable analytical methods including online water quality monitors,
</li><li>Evaluate the impact of MATS flue gas controls, e.g. Hg re-emission additives, bromide, trona, and activated carbon injection on FGD wastewater, and
</li><li>Provide industry-wide analysis of costs and benefits of potential wastewater treatment approaches, including physical/chemical, biological, and thermal ZLD approaches.
</li></ul>
<p>In 2016, a new project is being launched to evaluate and assist in the development of water quality monitors to support wastewater treatment operations. The program will continue to coordinate heavily with EPRI’s Power Plant Multimedia Toxics Characterization
 and Coal Combustion Products Environmental Issues programs to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the multimedia aspects of managing these effluent constituents, as well as with the Water Management Technology program to inform treatment technology
 research needs for meeting new effluent criteria. As EPA finalized the Effluent Guidelines rule in 2015, the program will continue to seek advisor feedback, and make adjustments to 2017 R&amp;D as needed.</p>

<p>Power plants are installing new air pollution control technologies (wet FGD technologies, SCR technologies, mercury controls such as bromide addition, Hg re-emission chemicals, activated carbon injection, and alkali injection e.g. hydrated lime and trona,
 as well as changing coal types, which may impact power plant wastewater characteristics. Facilities need accurate data to clarify the impact of plant operational changes on wastewater so that, if necessary, they can implement cost-effective wastewater management
 options while complying with current permit limits and negotiating future permits. Data developed in this program will assist resource agencies and other stakeholders in understanding the impacts of these changes on wastewater characterization and treatment
 capabilities.</p>

 bottom ash handling systems, and landfill leachate treatment. As the rulemaking process proceeds, opportunities may come up to continue to inform stakeholders with scientifically sound analyses and interpretation of all the data.</p>

<p>EPA recently finalized new standards for selenium, mercury, arsenic, and nitrates/nitrites for FGD wastewater. The final effluent guidelines revisions are based on an EPA Information Collection Request (ICR) and EPA sampling and analytical studies at seven
 coal power plants with wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater treatment systems.&nbsp; Thus the final standards are often based on limited data, both in regards to total number of facilities as well as in long-term variability with respect to changes in
 plant operations. &nbsp;Additional scientifically sound data are needed to continue support of the stakeholder community in providing stakeholders with the best information available, as well as assisting power plants develop wastewater management strategies.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI’s) “Power Plant Multimedia Toxics Characterization Program” provides state of the science information on pollutant partitioning and chemistry essential to power companies making environmental management decisions
 in an evolving landscape of fuel, environmental controls, and operating conditions.</p>
<p>In the United States and internationally, current and future air toxics emission, water discharge, and solid waste disposal regulations are likely to result in tighter limits and increased compliance costs for power companies and other industrial emissions
 sources. Control technologies for achieving increasingly stringent limits can be complex and costly to implement, especially in view of the potential need for flexibility to operate power plants in a cycling mode. Emissions from power plants into different
 media are closely interrelated because of transport from one medium to another. There is a critical need to address environmental releases in a holistic manner so that a pollutant removed by a control technology from one medium (such as air) does not adversely
 affect the levels in other media (such as water or solid waste). There will also be an increasing impetus to minimize the overall environmental footprint of power plants, achieved through retrofit and further optimization of existing power plant operations.
 The program will benefit companies in the U.S. and internationally who currently operate coal and gas-fired plants as well as those planning to build cleaner plants in the next 10-20 years.</p>
<p>EPRI's Power Plant Multimedia Toxics Characterization Program provides methods and tools for measuring and managing potentially toxic emissions and discharges from power plants, and prepares power companies to meet evolving regulations. The program helps
 industry, the scientific community, and the public evaluate discrete multimedia environmental impacts, as well as impacts that might result from changes in fuel composition or fuel blend, use of natural gas, implementation of new or enhanced pollution control
 technologies, or changes in plant operating practices. The research is coordinated with related work on emissions control technologies, air toxics risk assessment, as well as work on water characterization and management of combustion by-products. In view
 of the rapidly changing energy portfolio requirements, and the increasing deployment of alternative fuels such as biomass and distributed energy generation (e.g., fuel cells, solar) the program is embarking on new research to fully understand their environmental
 impacts.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program focuses on clarifying the chemistry and partitioning of pollutants in power plant process streams. EPRI began its power plant toxics characterization research more than 25 years ago. This long term outlook helps EPRI better anticipate issues,
 inform evolving regulations, and develop practical solutions. The research performed under this program enhances understanding of pollutant chemistry, provides methods and tools to accurately characterize the chemicals, and facilitates development of more
 effective pollution control strategies. Improved sampling and analytical methods can help reduce the risk of permit violations. The research provides credible emissions data to help power companies respond to permitting and regulatory requirements. The program
 addresses environmental impacts from use of natural gas as well as alternative fuels such as biomass, biofuels, and their co-firing with conventional fuels.</p>
<p>The program develops emissions estimates that are used as by other programs for risk assessment research. Measurement data produced by the program (and other sources) is compiled into the Power Plant Toxics Measurements Database, the most comprehensive database
 available on HAPs emissions. It is an online database containing primary information on the concentration partitioning of substances in power plant process and discharge streams. While this database has significant value in providing historical information
 on power plant emissions for regulatory purposes in the United States, there are also direct applications of the data for power companies managing pollutants in process streams internationally. The program assists power companies with Toxics Release Inventory
 (TRI) reporting by providing reporting software and emission factors, helping to minimize the cost of environmental compliance and make electricity more affordable. The TRI project will focus increasing attention on water issues to help address relevant issues
 in view of the recently revised Effluent Limitation Guidelines.</p>
<p>The Program’s research will ultimately benefit all stakeholders, including the public, by minimizing the overall costs of managing potentially toxic substances emanating from electric power generating facilities as well as minimizing adverse impacts to the
 environment.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program simultaneously characterizes air emissions, water discharges, and land releases holistically, to account for the inter-media transfer of multimedia pollutants, such as selenium. This approach facilitates implementation of a ‘cradle to grave’
 multimedia toxics management philosophy and helps minimize the cost of overall environmental compliance as well as the environmental footprint of power plant operations. This program delivers accurate characterization of chemical substances in fossil fuel-fired
 power plants waste streams and fuels. Characterization of power plant emissions and discharges requires accurate and sensitive analytical methods; where these do not exist, this program supports method development studies. The technical results from this program
 are highly applicable to international utilities.</p>
<p>An example of the holistic approach followed in this program is reflected in EPRI’s independent research planned to address post-MATS (Mercury and Air Toxics Standards) issues. MATS limits hazardous air pollutant (HAPs) emissions from coal- and oil-fired
 power plants. The regulation requires a residual risk assessment of the post-MATS industry and a technology review to assess whether additional regulations are appropriate to protect human health after the industry has complied with MATS. This may include
 an Information Collection Request (ICR) in 2018. The program research will compile lessons learned from a 2010 HAPs ICR and may propose to conduct new field sampling campaigns to assist in characterizing the HAPs emission profiles, especially for new power
 plant configurations where limited data currently exists. Recent revisions to effluent guidelines for the steam electric generation industry published, and recently issued rules regulating coal combustion residues (CCRs) from power plants may have a profound
 impact on the more effective management of water discharges and solid wastes, respectively.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Research derived from this program has credibility with regulators and the scientific community alike as a source of independent scientific information. Data generated from this program are valuable to power companies in improved plant operations and cost-effective
 environmental compliance. Program accomplishments include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessed the multimedia fate of mercury in power plants with selective catalytic reduction and wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems, as well as those of selenium and boron in wet FGDs</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed updated tools (the Power Plant Multimedia Toxics Database and TRI software) for environmental compliance and improved plant operation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed revised emission factor estimates for several HAPs of interest using the voluminous data from 2010 HAPs ICR as well as enhanced statistical techniques</p>
</li><li>
<p>Contributed to EPRI’s comments to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on measurement issues with the proposed Effluent Limitation Guidelines.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Provide extensive comments on EPA’s proposed HAPs Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule (now called the MATS rule); identified many significant errors in the data used to calculate MACT limits. EPA acknowledged EPRI’s scientific contributions
 in enhancing the quality of the ICR database, and the final MATS rule included recommendations from EPRI’s comments.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developed the QuickSEM as a mercury emissions reference method, a cost-effective sorbent-tube continuous mercury emissions monitoring system, later approved by the EPA as Method 30B.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>In 2017, the program will continue to focus on characterizing the occurrence and multimedia partitioning of toxic substances in fossil-fuel-fired power plants, especially on evaluating emissions from natural gas–fueled power plants and coal- and oil-fueled
 power plants with novel pollution controls. The program will continue to enhance the Power Plant Toxics Measurements Database and TRI reporting software, evaluate analytical methods for substances of environmental concern, and conduct multimedia environmental
 characterization and evaluations of power generation technologies and the associated environmental controls. The program will:</p>
<ul>

<p>In 2012, EPA issued a final MATS rule that regulates HAPs emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants. Compliance with the final rule began in April 2015, with a number of facilities were granted a compliance extension for one-year to April 2016.</p>
<p>EPA is required to conduct a residual risk assessment of the post-MATS industry by the 2020 timeframe as well as a series of technology reviews, to assess whether additional regulations may be needed to protect human health after the industry has complied
 with MATS. This may include an Information Collection Request (ICR) which could be conducted around the 2018 timeframe.&nbsp; Thus, power companies need to continue to characterize and investigate their post-MATS emissions and their potential risks to the public.
 The results from this project would help refine and inform any future HAPs ICR.</p>
<p>There is a need to examine multimedia releases (e.g., FGD water discharges and solid wastes) in addition to air emissions because technologies for controlling HAPs air emissions will impact the nature and composition of FGD wastewater discharges and solids
 such as coal ash and FGD byproducts (gypsum).</p>
<p>As the future generation fleet becomes more flexible, there is going to be an increase in cycling of fossil-powered power plants. Thus, there is a need to characterize emissions during startups and shutdowns because of increased cycling; these emissions
 can be significantly different from steady state values – especially for organics.</p>

<p>Rapidly changing energy portfolio requirements in many states are leading to renewed interest in alternative fuel sources such as biomass and biofuels, as well as in distributed generation. However, the multimedia environmental issues associated with use
 of these energy sources need to be fully understood to allow for their efficient and environmentally safe deployment. Compared to conventional fuels such as oil and gas, biomass and biofuels are expected to result in different emissions profiles due to their
 different and more heterogeneous composition, as well lower energy content. In addition, waste flows from and within power plants are expected to change, especially when alternative fuels are co-fired with coal. For distributed generation technology such as
 fuel cells for power generation air emissions are really not a problem; however, waste issues such as disposal /management of used catalysts (typically metals) will need to be addressed, most effectively on a life cycle basis.</p>

<p>Combustion of natural gas for electric power generation is increasing in the United States due to retirements of coal-fired power plants and the availability of relatively inexpensive natural gas. Natural gas combustion generally produces lower emissions
 of criteria pollutants and air toxics emissions per unit of energy produced compared to conventional coal-fired power plants. However, these emissions still need to be characterized and are subject to federal, state, and regional emissions limits. Power company
 staff may need to quantify emissions for permitting, emissions inventories, and Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting. Measuring emissions from natural gas-fired sources is challenging because of the relatively low concentrations. This project will compile
 existing test data, identify data gaps, and remedy the data gaps in hazardous air pollutant (HAPs) emissions from gas-fired power generation sources via well-designed field studies. The collected test data will be used to develop robust emission factors for
 combustion turbines, reciprocating internal combustion engines, and other unit types of interest. Since gas-fired plants are expected to be more frequently operated in a cycling mode (rapid startup and shutdown), the emission profile during cycling mode also
 needs to be ascertained.</p>
<p>In addition to air emissions, there is a need to quantify potential impacts to water and land from natural gas combustion. Natural gas fired plants use water primarily for cooling. Water discharges from the plants can potentially have an impact on water
 bodies from which water is withdrawn and returned, and on aquatic life. The volumes of solid and liquid wastes generated from natural gas-fired plants are much lower than coal-fired plants, but may present unique management challenges. Attention also needs
 to be paid to the interplay between media – i.e., potential transfer of pollutants from one medium to another, to facilitate holistic management of the chemicals of interest.</p>

<p>Accurate characterization of potentially toxic chemicals in fuels, reagents, intermediate process streams, air emissions, liquid and solid waste streams, and other discharges is essential for developing effective strategies for multimedia management of these
 chemicals. Some existing sampling and analytical methods do not have the required sensitivity or specificity to meet increasingly stringent regulatory needs. Better methods, and validation of existing methods, are needed to support compliance monitoring. The
 drivers for this research are regulatory programs that require new pollution control technologies and impose increasingly strict limits on emissions to air, land, and water. For example, FGD systems will divert some metals from stack gas to wastewater. Power
 plants facing tighter surface water discharge limits for these metals may not be able to measure them accurately with existing analytical methods. Preservation techniques for samples that avoid changing or contaminating the sample will become increasingly
 important.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF) and Radio-Frequency (RF) Health Assessment and Safety program supports and conducts research addressing key environmental health and safety issues related to public and worker exposure to electromagnetic field environments
 associated with electric power system infrastructure. Historically, issues investigated power frequency (60 Hz) fields produced by transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) lines, generating stations, and substations. Over the forty-plus years since EPRI’s founding
 and as the science evolves, the program adapted its research portfolio to focus on health and safety issues related to power frequencies. The portfolio includes streamlined efforts related to cancer and reproductive outcomes, drawing from several disciplines
 including epidemiology, exposure assessment, life sciences, and engineering.</p>
<p>Smart grid technologies, distributed energy resources (DER), the large-scale introduction of electric vehicles and associated charging infrastructures, the expansion of wireless communications, and other innovations drive the expansion of the spectrum of
 interest for residential exposures to radiofrequencies up to 3 gigahertz (GHz, a billion Hz). Along with the power frequency health and safety issues that remain under investigation, the program periodically addresses RF issues that include field characterizations
 of smart meter emissions, ambient urban environments, electric vehicles and associated charging operations, and commercial solar photovoltaic installations. Communication of its results and perspectives to all stakeholders remains a core part of the program.&nbsp;
 Research efforts contribute to the public benefit in terms of environmentally responsible electrical energy, and further the vision of a flexible, resilient and, connected electrical grid.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program addresses high-priority issues concerning potential health effects related to EMF and RF exposures by contributing to the body of scientific knowledge, contributing to accurate health risk evaluations and informing exposure guideline development.
 The EPRI EMF program is the longest-running comprehensive research program addressing ongoing and emerging EMF and RF health issues, bringing EPRI an international reputation as an authoritative source of EMF information. EPRI research provides scientific
 information to address issues raised by local constituencies with respect to new facility construction or upgrades (transmission lines, substations). Such input provides public benefit because when delays are shortened it directly translates to reduced project
 costs associated with expensive rerouting and undergrounding. Over the past ten years, the EPRI program has focused on the basis for the association between childhood leukemia and residential magnetic fields. However, the program has responded to other needs
 which periodically surface such as conducting first-of-its-kind measurements of RF emissions from smart meters, creating information for the public, regulators, and the scientific community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program addresses key health and safety issues related to exposure of the general public and utility workers to electromagnetic environments from across the non-ionizing spectrum. With respect to power frequency magnetic fields, the health endpoints
 of highest priority include childhood leukemia, miscarriage and neurodegenerative diseases. The program has also conducted characterizations of environments associated with new technologies, including smart meters, electric vehicles and their charging apparatus,
 wireless bus charging, commercial solar photovoltaic facilities, and the background urban RF environment. EPRI research are published in the peer-reviewed literature and incorporated into international risk assessments, and public utility commission/public
 service commission proceedings for approving new line and substation projects.</p>

<p>This project addresses the need to characterize electromagnetic environments across the non-ionizing spectrum: from 0 Hz (DC) to over 5 gigahertz (GHz) or greater, which includes 50/60 Hz fields associated with transmission (ac and dc) and distribution (T&amp;D).
 These electromagnetic environments, among others, include RF exposures from advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure (including wireless charging), and distributed energy resources (DER). Accurate exposure
 characterization is essential for addressing public and worker concerns about the potential new exposure environments and potential health effects.</p>
<p>Distributed generation such as offshore wind turbines and tidal and wave energy generators alike will need to be linked to the mainland system through undersea cables. There is also an ongoing development of transmission capacity under bodies of waters (sea,
 lakes, and rivers). Potential impacts due to EMF from these submerged underwater cables will need to be evaluated in numerous aquatic species. Finally, integrating the expanding amount of distributed energy resources (DER) seamlessly into the smart grid will
 become a priority challenge from an engineering perspective. The large-scale deployment of DER may likely produce current pathways through distribution lines and grounding systems which may require attention as these new environments are in closer proximity
 to the public and may stir public concern.</p>

<p>Public and worker concerns over possible health effects from exposure to the extremely low frequency (ELF)-EMF and RF fields associated with the electric power system and sources such as panel antennas, wireless networks, and automatic metering infrastructure
 drive the need for new scientific research. Renewed concerns over EMF may arise in association with planning and deployment of new or expanded T&amp;D projects. Power companies and their staff must be positioned to communicate to their customers, regulators and
 employees relevant EMF and RF information.</p>

<p>International and national and risk assessments conducted by agencies such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) concluded, primarily based on the epidemiologic association
 between ELF-MF and childhood leukemia, that magnetic fields are possibly carcinogenic to humans. In 2007, the World Health Organization published an assessment reaffirming IARC’s conclusion.&nbsp; However, the organization noted uncertainties remain for childhood
 leukemia as well as several other health endpoints, including miscarriage and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&nbsp; Along with well-conducted, focused research to resolve scientific uncertainties, effective
 communication is essential to translate current EMF health research. Moreover, construction of transmission lines in rural areas or linking offshore renewable generation to the mainland grid raise concerns about potential effects of EMF exposure on community
 health such as fish migration.</p>

<p>The EMF and RF Health Assessment Occupational Studies project set produces scientific research and information on important occupational EMF/RF health and safety issues. The project set can provide data needed for improving basis for EMF and RF exposure
 guidelines. Current guidelines protect against neurostimulatory (EMF) or thermal (RF) effects arising through known biophysical mechanisms; however, guideline limits have yet to combine all the recent advances in dosimetry, dose-effect relationships, and exposure
 modeling, to which EPRI research has contributed significantly. Along with conducting research, EPRI continues to monitor guideline revisions and other developments. The EPRI occupational project set continues to provide technical summaries of medical implant
 and ELF and RF literature and to identify gaps in research. EPRI occupational health studies focus on neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease, among electrical and other workers. As both implanted
 active (e.g., pacemakers, defibrillators) and passive (e.g., plates, screws, artificial joints) medical devices, are increasingly being used by active workers and the general population potential interference from ELF and RF/EMF exposure remains a concern.</p>

<p>The EMF and RF Occupational Health project set includes a focus on epidemiologic, exposure guidelines, and exposure assessment relevant to the workplace.&nbsp; With respect to epidemiologic work, the World Health Organization (WHO) assigned a high priority to
 research ALS among those working in electrical occupations and Alzheimer's disease in relation to magnetic field exposure in its 2007 EMF health risk assessment. &nbsp;Exposure guidelines and standards aim to protect persons against adverse electrostimulation for
 frequencies less than about 100 kHz.&nbsp; For higher frequencies up to 300 GHz, guidelines and standards aim to protect against adverse effects associated with tissue heating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertainties remain about the scientific bases for these exposure limits and their
 relationship to dose.&nbsp; As new work environments are created as electric companies plan new transmission and distribution projects and deal with increasing electricity demand by delivering electricity from alternative energy resources. Finally, accurate exposure
 assessment is critical for minimizing worker exposures near RF, wireless facilities and other emerging energy technologies.&nbsp;</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Workplace injuries affect employee health, quality of life, occupational productivity, and job satisfaction. Efforts to reduce the burden of injuries and illnesses, medical costs, and productivity losses, while helping to improve worker morale and workforce
 retention, are a critical part of electric power company operations. Within the electric power industry, typical risks may result from poor ergonomic design in equipment, misguided procedures, and long-term or repetitive exposure to various physical and chemical
 agents. Companies must develop strategies capable of protecting workers while meeting compliance with worker health and safety requirements for reliable, uninterrupted delivery of electricity to customers. Regulatory standard setting and rulemaking by the
 Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), as well as sister agencies in Canada and the European Union, influence the amount of exposure monitoring, injury prevention and training programs, and engineering controls or best practice guidelines required
 within the electric sector.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) Occupational Health and Safety program provides scientific research needed for informed decisions about control methods geared toward workplace injury and illness prevention. Products, tools, and design recommendations
 emerging from this research help electric power companies maintain safer, healthier work environments and control labor-related costs. The research identifies injury and illness trends, develops cost-effective ergonomic interventions and designs, and addresses
 critical occupational exposure issues. The program serves as the foundation for occupational health and safety–related work within the electric utility industry.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p></p>
<p>Lost productivity and medical costs from occupational injuries significantly contribute to operational costs, reliability, and workforce retention within the electric power industry.&nbsp; Scientific research provides the basis for informed health and safety
 practices for current and anticipated future electric utility infrastructure. This program provides the scientific research needed for informed decisions on strategies for injury prevention, safety program targets, exposure controls, regulatory compliance,
 and intervention and training methods.The research provides insight into future health and safety deliberations and an integrated approach for occupational planning in the electricity sector based on the integration of health, exposure, and surveillance data.
 If effectively integrated within the safety management systems of electric power companies, EPRI products and research results may contribute to the reduction of these effects.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The following key electric utility industry research challenges have been categorized by EPRI’s advisory team and informs a 2017 and beyond&nbsp;action plan: &nbsp;1) Identifying and quantifying human health impacts associated with exposure to chemical, physical,
 and biological hazards, some of which have yet to be characterized, 2) Providing cost-effective countermeasures and intervention strategies to facilitate mitigation of workforce health and safety risks, &nbsp;3) &nbsp;Developing and using information integration tools
 for better assimilating workforce-related adverse health incidence data, 4) Establishing industry-wide safety risk management process improvement guidelines and standards and 5) Fostering a “Beyond Compliance” approach through establishment of an EPRI Safety
 Center of Excellence.</p>
<p>To date, several major areas of research have been established and expanded to characterize risks to the electric utility workforce and determine efficacy of countermeasures and intervention methods.&nbsp; Program highlights include ongoing world-class applied
 research structured into the following project areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P62.001 - Occupational Health and Safety Database:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A unique source of detailed, comprehensive, standardized injury and illness rates and statistical analyses specifically for the electricity industry; it serves as a baseline measure of
 injury occurrence for the sector, enabling consistent long-term analysis, benchmarking, and anchoring of leading safety and injury prevention indicators.
</li><li><strong>P62.002 - Ergonomics Research:</strong>&nbsp; This research identifies injury trends; characterizes new occupational human factors and ergonomics risks; and develops potential new cost-effective, end-to-end ergonomic interventions and/or designs to help
 ensure workers are free from disabilities when they retire. </li><li><strong>P62.003 - Occupational Exposure and Health Studies:</strong>&nbsp; These research studies focus on building infrastructure for exposure characterization and health impacts of temperature extremes, noise, chemical and industrial hygiene stressors, and
 other safety concerns (such as&nbsp;shift work and driving safety)&nbsp;within the electric utility sector to inform regulatory policy and health-protecting strategies.

<p>A long-term series of field observation, laboratory, and engineering studies has characterized the role of ergonomic factors across work tasks, resulting in process recommendation and design remedies across the sector. This project continues to mature by
 analyzing the translation and relative success of this science within the sector, including helping identify methods for economic evaluation and effective application. These studies will continue to identify and feed back into the development of additional
 ergonomic research.</p>
<p>This research will also explore corollary and causal relationships between intervention strategies and actual injury performance. This will involve a detailed review of specific injury types (e.g. soft tissue, sprain and strain) and the subsequent impact
 of the mitigation strategies had on reducing these types of injuries. Intervention strategy specifics, implementation timelines, training and education efforts will be analyzed to show the relationships.</p>

<p>This research investigates relationships among injury and illness occurrence rates, lifestyle factors, and workplace exposures. Current issues of interest include exposure to physical (temperature extremes and noise) agents, chemical (beryllium, sulfur hexafluoride
 decomposition, dioxin/furan) agents as well as respiratory (silica, welding fumes, etc.) agents. Development of a comprehensive, sector-specific exposure database continues in order to better inform workplace monitoring, thereby providing significant cost
 savings by pooling available industrial hygiene data from participating companies.</p>
<p>Exposure characterization and epidemiologic research will continue to address occupational and lifestyle factors potentially associated with injuries and illnesses, together with statistical analyses of existing occupational exposure and health information,
 provide further insight into causal relationships and mitigation strategies. The research will seek to develop processes members may use to successfully protect employees from exposure constituents, as well as provide proactive engineering controls which can
 be incorporated into operational activities reducing exposure potential.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The majority of fossil plants worldwide are more than 30 years old and are experiencing increased demand for operational flexibility while addressing age-related issues for major components. High-energy steam and water piping systems are among the most important
 safety issues at fossil plants and must be managed reliably through the aging process. Safety and availability loss due to pressure part failures are two key issues driving R&amp;D on major fossil power plant components. Boiler tube failures (BTFs) continue to
 be the leading cause of lost availability in fossil-fired steam plants worldwide.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Boiler Life and Availability Improvement Program (Program 63) collaborates internationally to develop technology and guidance on safe management of boiler component life to increase reliability and reduce
 operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Efforts focus on advanced inspection techniques for early and accurate identification of component damage; analytical tools to predict remaining life and risk of in-service failure; and decision-support tools to help
 balance risk and benefit under a variety of operating scenarios.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Power generators need to balance the risks and costs of the largest, most costly equipment in the power plant and focus on using proven technologies to create solutions. By using the results of the R&amp;D in this program, plant owners and operators can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the costs of lost availability due to boiler tube failures when program results are applied comprehensively
</li><li>Increase the safety of high-energy and high-temperature piping systems </li><li>Increase safety through control of flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC) in fossil plants
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program portfolio includes guidelines, reports, software code, and tools applicable to all boilers, focused on the goals of optimal availability and performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on boiler component inspection and monitoring develops reliable and cost-effective nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to reduce O&amp;M costs and improve life-management options. NDE developments in other industries also are evaluated for application
 to fossil plants. </li><li>Tools for boiler component life management provide a comprehensive approach to creating technical bases for minimizing in-service component damage and for component remaining-life assessment. Both areas are critical for high reliability and maximum equipment
 life. </li><li>High-energy steam and water piping safety and reliability of high-energy piping systems in fossil power plants are enhanced by information provided on how damage mechanisms affect piping components and on remaining life tools. Tools are developed that allow
 engineers to more accurately predict the remaining life of piping systems. </li></ul>

<p>EPRI developed a lifing calculator to predict remaining creep and fatigue life for Grade 91 steels approximately five years ago.&nbsp; It has since been upgraded to include several other low alloy materials.&nbsp; One of the key benefits to using this EPRI product
 is it is the only software to contain creep properties on soft Grade 91 which may have resulted from uncontrolled processing.&nbsp; An identified need for this lifing calculator is documentation on application examples and benefits realized from its use.</p>

<p>Wet Fluorescent Magnetic Particle Testing (WFMT) is generally used during initial fabrication inspections and post service inspections to determine if surface breaking flaws are present.&nbsp; This inspection is normally performed around welds or other areas
 where surface flaws are expected.&nbsp; The process is messy and requires a dark environment to be performed.&nbsp; Freezing weather adds additional challenges to use of this approach.&nbsp; Eddy current inspection has been shown to be able to be quickly performed with no
 mess or surface preparation and potentially could be performed more economically for these inspections.</p>

<p>In recent EPRI research, eddy current equipment, using specialized processing, was shown to be able to locate repair welds in cast Grade 91 valves.&nbsp; Locating longitudinal seam and girth welds in piping systems is often a difficult task, and made more difficult
 if the weld has been ground or machined smooth on the outside surface.&nbsp; Traditional methods include acid etching which is a time consuming (due to surface preparation requirements) and can have some amount of risk (due to use of the acid).&nbsp; Even acid etching

<p>While United States power plants have traditionally used lower alloyed steels like Grades 11 and 22 for steam piping systems, chrome moly vanadium (CrMoV) materials have been used for many years in Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world.&nbsp; The strengthening
 mechanisms for this alloy have demonstrated low ductility failures which make life assessment activities challenging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typical damage in high temperature piping systems is related to welds, either in the weld metal or the Type IV location.&nbsp; Life assessment of these systems has typically been performed using a combination of calculations and inspections and damage is generally
 repaired by welding.&nbsp; At some point, after significant damage and repair of welds, damage will accumulate in the parent metal.&nbsp; How to address this damage is an industry concern as the area involved does not lend itself well to an inspection life management
 technology.&nbsp; It is expected that damage will first be seen in bends and then in lesser stressed straight sections of pipe.</p>

 operation occurs throughout a fossil-fired unit, the specific area of interest of this report is water-touched boiler components.</p>

 stick type explosive resulting in higher probability of damage to surrounding components. If a lower velocity det (detonation) cord could be found or developed, it may provide good results for areas that are difficult to clean with stick type explosives.</p>

 A majority of the life assessment predictions for this material is based on short term creep tests on new parent metal and cross welds.&nbsp; There is a need to better understand in-service material behavior that will allow the industry to develop more accurate

<p>In 2015, EPRI investigated the physical thermohydraulics of supercritical water in waterwalls.&nbsp; The project found that close to the pseudo-critical boiling point changes in the water’s ability to absorb heat from the tubing could result in temperature spikes
 within the tube metal.&nbsp; Most investigations in pseudo-critical boiling within tubing has been limited to single tubes, not membrane panels.&nbsp; It is important to understand the impact of pseudo-critical boiling on membrane panel performance and reliability.</p>

 of damage could occur, it would be very time consuming to perform this type of inspection.&nbsp; This project will investigate nondestructive evaluation technologies to rapidly detect blasting damage in superheat and reheat tubing.</p>

<p>Current life management approaches for advanced creep strength enhanced ferritic (CSEF) steel Grades 91 and 92 predominately rely on random inspection and using traditional, borrowed strategies from the experience base for low alloy steels. As evidenced
 by the complexity of Grades 91 and 92, and an evolving service experience which includes a number of failures documented in key EPRI reports, it is clear that a defined, well-engineered approach to life management is required which enables the owner/operator
 to better rank and prioritize susceptible components or systems for inspection. In this way, the uncertainty in life management will be reduced and the probability to finding damage (should it exist in a system or component) will be increased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Replication (the use of an acetate film to produce a likeness of the surface microstructure) has been used for many years as an indicator where a component may be in its lifetime.&nbsp; It provides many benefits but also has been misapplied in many instances.&nbsp;
 It only provides information about the microstructure on the surface and should not be used where damage is expected to develop subsurface.&nbsp; Most of the guidance on use of acetate films was developed for low alloy steels.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this has been misapplied
 to alloys like Grade 91. Guidance on proper use of acetate films is needed.</p>

<p>The ability to predict the occurrence of flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC) in an operating plant is key to safe and economical operation. EPRI’s Fossil FAC Advisor employs complex empirical models to predict the location and severity of FAC throughout a plant’s
 coolant system.&nbsp; Program 63 (Boiler Reliability), in collaboration with Program 64 (Cycle Chemistry) have been sponsoring research on several FAC damage influence mechanisms including two phase flow and entrance effect.&nbsp; An update to the FAC Advisor software
 is needed to incorporate these improved understandings in damage influence mechanisms.</p>

<p>Boiler and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) tube failures have been the primary availability problem for operators of conventional and combined cycle plants for as long as reliable statistics have been kept for each generating source. In 2011 EPRI produced
 a three-volume set of documents to provide owners and operators with the technical basis to address tube failures and create permanent solutions (<em>Boiler and Heat Recover Steam Generator Tube Failures: Theory and Practice.&nbsp;
</em>EPRI report 1023603:<em> Volume 1: Fundamentals, Volume 2: Water-Touched Tubes, Volume 3: Steam-Touched Tubes).</em>&nbsp; The significant amount of additional operating experience now available since first publication of this series needs to be captured and
 documented to provide improved guidance to reduce boiler tube failures.</p>

<p>Proper failure analysis and material testing of components removed from service is crucial to increasing the information database of operating power plants.&nbsp; One example is information gathered from a recent evaluation of a failed Grade 91 header from Europe.&nbsp;
 Detailed investigation into why the header failed early has guided EPRI to issue a new material specification.&nbsp; Post-service-exposure testing may include small sample or standard size tests to better understand material degradation.&nbsp; Understanding how dissimilar
 metal welds fail are also a possibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The life assessment methodologies used for superheater and reheater tubing and contained in software like EPRI’s TULIP computer code are based on oxide grown in short-term elevated temperature tests and benchmarked against moderate term service-aged tubing.&nbsp;
 With tubing being removed from service after extensive hours of operation (up to 500,000 hours), a unique opportunity is now available to measure oxide thickness and characterize the microstructure of these long-term service relevant oxides in order to benchmark
 and potentially improve the oxide thickness models used in EPRI life assessment methodologies.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Safety and availability loss due to failures are two key issues driving R&amp;D on major fossil (coal, simple-cycle and combined-cycle gas) power plant components, especially in older plants. Operators need to minimize major causes of lost availability and associated
 maintenance costs related to corrosion and inadequate cycle chemistry to prevent boiler and/or heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) tube failures, steam turbine blade/disc failures and flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC).</p>
<p>Generation assets are experiencing increasing demands for greater operating flexibility, low-load operation, and more frequent unit shutdowns and cycling. These demands are raising additional key issues, including the dynamic impacts on plant systems and
 the preservation of equipment. Operators need to minimize and mitigate the increased risk of corrosion damage and component failures resulting from these operating regimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Boiler and Turbine Steam and Cycle Chemistry Program (Program 64) offers guidelines, technology, and training materials to help plant operators manage water/steam cycle chemistry, reduce unplanned outages
 and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, and improve unit efficiency, as well as address chemistry requirements of flexible operation and proper equipment storage.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The industry needs to balance the risks and costs of the largest, most costly equipment by using proven technologies to create solutions. By using the results of the R&amp;D in this program, members can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve overall unit availability and flexibility: Losses due to improper chemistry have a 1% or more effect on unit availability
</li><li>Reduce steam turbine efficiency losses: Chemical and metallic oxide deposits reduce turbine efficiencies by up to 2%
</li><li>Reduce chemistry-related boiler and HRSG tube failures </li><li>Reduce incidence of FAC damage and failures: FAC is both a personnel safety and component availability concern
</li><li>Reduce chemistry-related O&amp;M costs </li><li>Improve methods of major equipment preservation and storage </li><li>Reduce incidence of chemistry-related corrosion damage associated with low-load and cyclic operation
</li><li>Improve cycle chemistry programs to excellent or world-class status </li></ul>
<p>This program enhances the reliability and safety of water-steam-cycle-driven power plants (including coal, natural gas combined-cycle, biomass and solar thermal). The program R&amp;D investigates the corrosion and deposition damage mechanisms of the components
 in water-steam cycles and provides guidelines, technologies, and management practices to maximize their reliable and safe operation.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Cycle chemistry guidelines, technologies, and training materials support efforts to minimize operating risks associated with corrosion and deposition. Technical tools developed through this program include unit-specific chemical treatment methods, operating
 limits, and monitoring guidelines to improve plant availability, efficiency, minimum load operation, startup times, and equipment storage. Chemistry guidelines address all critical aspects of fossil plant water/steam cycle chemistry, including boiler and feed-water
 treatments; chemistry and corrosion control in the steam turbine phase transition zone (PTZ); corrosion in the boiler/HRSG and water/steam cycle; FAC in high-energy piping and air-cooled condensers; deposition in major plant components in the water/steam cycle;
 shutdown/startup/layup; condensate polishing; makeup, instrumentation; chemical cleaning; and corrosion concerns in copper and other alternative materials of construction.</p>
<p>Members can use the guidelines, research information, and models developed from these activities to identify specific actions needed to address deficiencies consistent with individual unit characteristics. Application of risk assessments and best practices
 provide managers tools to evaluate conditional situations in an informed and cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>Component damage associated with flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC) is often very localized and isolated. The subtle variations in the environmental conditions (chemistry) are not identifiable as contributory to significant changes in the corrosion rate. Due
 to the confined nature of the corrosion activity, measurement of the results of the corrosion through techniques such as corrosion product transport or physical inspection are insensitive to reaction kinetics. Treatment regimes to mitigate corrosion activity
 are principally focused on establishing corrosion potentials which favor stabilization of the metal or metallic oxide; however, real-time measurement of the corrosion rate at the site in actual field or simulated conditions of localized attack resulting from
 FAC are typically unavailable.</p>
<p>Electrochemical corrosion measurements at condensate/feedwater temperatures with a probe assembly designed to promote a mode of corrosion (e.g., orifice to simulate FAC) have been established using various techniques in laboratory test loops. The adaptation
 of these techniques to an online probe providing a real-time measurement of corrosion potential may permit for improved cycle chemistry monitoring and corrosion control. A second method using active acoustic emission external to pipework has also been demonstrated
 in the lab to effectively detect when FAC is active and when it has been stifled by switching to an oxidizing chemistry. The development of a field tool using this technology may lead to improved maintenance planning and corrosion control.</p>
<p>Direct measurement of actual or simulated conditions would be beneficial in assessing the risk of upset condition of contamination or loss of chemical control and the corrosion hazards to operating conditions. Commercial development of online FAC<em>monitoring
 of corrosion rates will provide not only improved guidance but an essential measurement of the cycle chemistry control.</p>

<p>Filming amines have been demonstrated to form hydrophobic films on subcritical and supercritical fossil boiler tubing. Filming has been achieved in both steam-touched (superheater/reheater) and water-touched (waterwall) tubing. A hydrophobic film is anticipated
 to inhibit corrosion by disrupting corrosion cells; however, to date the level of this corrosion inhibition for known offline and online boiler/HRSG tube corrosion mechanisms has not been quantified. There is the potential that film formation can impact corrosion
 fatigue, stress corrosion cracking, pitting, and underdeposit corrosion mechanisms. This project would look to establish the level of corrosion inhibition achieved in actual field applications of filming amines.</p>

<p>Filming amines have advantages in corrosion control over traditional treatments. Through the formation of hydrophobic films on internal steam/water surfaces, they can disrupt corrosion cells. These products have been shown to significantly improve corrosion
 product transport in numerous fossil plant field applications. However, conventional power plant chemistry monitoring techniques are incapable of evaluating whether film formation has occurred, significantly complicating continuous control and optimization
 of filming amine-based treatments. Additionally, variation in filming amine formulations means that there is no single analytical technique for evaluating the presence of the chemical in water and steam samples. In addition, as the chemical formulations vary,
 there is also no universal correlation between the concentrations found in flowing water and steam samples and the level of film formation, which is how these chemicals afford protection.</p>
<p>The industry needs a fully articulated treatment for filming amines that companies can use to optimize these treatments independently of chemical suppliers.</p>

 specification for a non-critical reason. This complicates the development of meaningful alarms for cycle chemistry monitoring. A common example of a measurement error are the errors associated with the measurement of cation conductivity once the cation column
 has exhausted. A common example of a non-critical out of specification conditions is the steam cation conductivity upset typically associated with a startup where carbon dioxide causes the measurement to go significantly out of specification. In both cases
 typical chemistry alarm logic would indicate a major excursion even though in both cases there was no actual risk of equipment damage. Since the vast majority of chemistry excursions are associated with these types of events, where the equipment is actually
 not at risk, operators can become desensitized to the chemistry alarms and assume they are always not relevant. It is possible using techniques from EPRI’s Cycle Chemistry Instrumentation Validation: Relationships of Cycle Chemistry Parameters Report 1019641,
 to develop smart chemistry alarms which only come in when an actual chemistry event is occurring such as a condenser leak or pH excursion.</p>

<p>Steam purity and other chemistry limits have different operating experience-based action levels, which allow for a time period of operation (e.g., 24 hours) above limits prior to forcing a unit shutdown to mitigate the risk of corrosion and deposition damage.
 These experiential action limits have not been validated. With many fossil units requiring increasingly flexible operations, in which they face a need to be available at specific times to meet the electricity supply requirement in markets where non-dispatchable
 renewables are dominant, quantifying the risk from out-of-spec operation becomes more important. This study will attempt to validate the values used for steam purity action levels by associating them with more specific corrosion risks.</p>

<p>Cycle chemistry guideline documents typically exceed 200 pages, and in the case of the makeup guidelines exceeds 800 pages. These documents are developed for specialist plant staff to provide a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry mechanisms and
 the overall treatment technology. The extensive detail in the documents make them generally inaccessible to plant generalist staff, such as plant operations staff. Despite the fact that these documents often contain much pertinent information for generalist
 staff’s roles and responsibilities. This project would distill the key guidance on the operation and troubleshooting of common demineralized water production equipment necessary for generalist operations staff.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The power generation industry today requires strategies for maintaining turbine-generator system availability. This requires a focus not only on maintenance outage planning and execution, but on mitigating risk of unplanned outages as well. EPRI’s research
 program addresses the changing needs as the coal and gas fleet adapts to an evolving mission profile.</p>
<p>The EPRI’s Steam Turbines-Generators and Auxiliary Systems program (Program 65) supports continuous improvement in the safety and availability of steam turbines, generators, and auxiliary systems. It supports all aspects of turbine-generator component life-cycle
 management. &nbsp;This support is accomplished through applied research in component life management, preventive maintenance, condition assessment, advanced monitoring, and control systems.</p>
<p>The program fosters collaboration among all industry stakeholders to support proactive strategies and best-practice sharing to solve industry reliability issues. The ongoing research and technology transfer activities fully support the needs of member organizations
 seeking to improve knowledge and effectiveness of turbine-generator system engineers.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Using an integrated approach that incorporates work from related EPRI programs and industry input from user groups, this program focuses on reducing operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, managing risk, providing technical support for plant staff, and producing
 information to support upgrade studies and asset management strategies. Research results inform run/repair/replace decisions and provide detailed guidance for planning and performing critical overhaul and maintenance activities.</p>
<p>By participating in this program, plant operators obtain information that they can use to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce maintenance costs </li><li>Maintain high asset availability </li><li>Take proactive measures to lower operating risks </li><li>Extend component life </li><li>Increase staff technical expertise and awareness of industry issues </li></ul>
<p>Involvement in the program can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate participants about turbine-generator (T-G) issues and solutions </li><li>Provide opportunities to share information with industry experts, engineers, major T-G original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and vendor/service providers worldwide
</li></ul>
<p>This program improves the reliability and availability of steam turbines and generators, key drivers of overall plant performance for all asset types. It is essential for plant viability, and therefore bulk power availability, to cost-effectively maintain
 and operate large steam turbine generators. Safety of the power plant environment is also dependent of effective management of component failure risk, which is an element of this program.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program produces a range of deliverables including published guidelines, software, web applications, specialized sensors, and technical meetings/webcasts. Specific project selection is based on periodic advisor input and issue prioritization. The portfolio
 addresses current areas of need such as flexible operations, risk management, component upgrades, nondestructive examination, condition monitoring technologies, preventive maintenance (PM) guides, and repair strategies. Project advisory groups are involved
 in project scope creation, draft report reviews, and sharing of research implementation best-practices. The Turbine-Generator Users Group (TGUG), included with Program 65 membership, provides an effective forum for sharing emerging issues and research implementation
 experiences, as well as guiding further EPRI research in key areas. In addition, program members have access to recorded technical webcasts, an annual newsletter, and a catalog of past research abstracts. These documents allow members to easily disseminate
 the latest knowledge to key staff at the main office and plants.</p>
<p>Many members begin their participation in Program 65 research through regular participation in the TGUG biannual meetings. These meetings are member-run forums for sharing technical knowledge, awareness of emerging reliability issues, and O&amp;M best-practices
 among turbine-generator system engineers. The group also provides a structured forum for engaging the major turbine-generator equipment manufacturers worldwide. Program members also are eligible to attend the workshops associated with the biannual group meetings.</p>
<p>Potential projects for the following year's R&amp;D portfolio are discussed and prioritized with the program member advisors during the program advisory meetings held twice yearly. Roundtable discussions held at the advisory meetings, as well as the TGUG, provide
 opportunities for EPRI's collaborative R&amp;D to immediately address emerging issues that broadly affect the industry.</p>

<p>Unusual events such as stator core over fluxing, synchronization out of phase, loss of cooling water to hydrogen coolers, loss of excitation etc., can inflict significant damage and accelerate the aging process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence shows the industry experiences inadvertent energizing of the generator at standstill with significant rotor damage about every 24 month. Similarly, generator core over fluxing that may require partial core lamination replacement occurs
 about every 3 years. These incidents are caused by equipment failure but often made worse by human error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since these events occur infrequently, the operator may not have prior experience to recognize the event and act to limit the consequential damage.</p>

<p>Most generators that are in service today were not specifically designed for weekly or daily shut downs. In addition, wide-spread use of renewable generation requires fast loading of conventional assets.</p>
<p>The generator rotor and stator will experience frequent copper winding expansion, mechanical and thermal stresses, accelerated aging and low cycle fatigue for rotor components such as the “J strap”.&nbsp; The effect of this on condition of each generator depends
 on design, vintage, past operating duty and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equivalent Operating Hours (EOH) calculations are often used to determine inspection intervals. An example is the VGB Guideline R 167 “Overhaul recommendations for turbo-generators”. The weighting factors used to multiply the operating hours, number of starts/stops,
 hours on turning gear, active and reactive power, and operating duty have been agreed upon by various original equipment manufacturers, however, the guideline does not provide technical basis for these weighing factors.</p>
<p>There is a need to develop a process for&nbsp;determining inspection intervals that are plant-and machine-specific.</p>

<p>U.S. power plans experience a generator core meltdown about every five years. This catastrophic failure occurs without warning and the root-cause investigation is hampered by destruction of the evidence.</p>
<p>The stator core can be damaged during an outage. During operation vibration of loose core lamination, foreign object impact cause deterioration of core lamination insulation, which results in electrical currents circulating through the core material, causing
 it to severely overheat and melt.</p>
<p>Generator condition monitors (GCM) provide strong indicators of severe overheating of the core insulation. The indication of overheating does not prevent the core damage, but it can limit the consequential damage and identify dangerous operating ranges.&nbsp;
 The industry needs an earlier indication of core health degradation to reduce the risk of a costly catastrophic failure.</p>

<p>There is need for a technical basis to support the run-replace decision that follows discovery of damage to the pad surfaces of fluid-film bearings during inspections. In previous years of activity in this project, Version 1.0 of the Bearing Action Advisor
 (BAA)&nbsp;web application was developed and made available for use by EPRI members. This web application allows the user to define basic parameters of fluid-film bearings. These bearing types include cylindrical or bumper thrust. With the parameters, the user
 can also provide input on observed damage. The BAA tool then calculates the load-carrying capacity and risk associated with a decision to keep the pad in service.</p>
<p>In 2017, Version 1.0&nbsp;of the BAA will be updated to&nbsp;Version 2.0, which will include tilt-pad bearing types. There will be a need following this release to promote use of the new software and support individual member applications. From this activity, enhancements
 to the tools can be defined for future releases.</p>

<p>There is an industry need for improved condition-based maintenance of hydraulically-actuated steam valves used for turbine applications. The current time-based approach to scheduling overhaul intervals is, in many cases,&nbsp;conservative and results in increased
 maintenance costs. It is also possible that increased time-based intervals would fail to observe&nbsp;valve condition degradation, resulting in costly unplanned maintenance.</p>
<p>This multi-year project will examine the technical feasibility of incorporating on-line valve condition monitoring, with a focus on the major component degradation mechanisms inherent to the valve and actuator.&nbsp; The research will focus on the use of existing
 sensors, or new, commercially-available sensors that can be cost-effectively deployed on stop and control valves. New methods for analyzing the valve control signals as a way to detect emerging degradation will also be researched. The overall result of the
 EPRI research will be an assessment of the technology needs, costs, and impacts to the plant of widespread deployment of on-line valve condition monitoring. Follow-on work involving prototype system installation at a host plant would be considered based on
 the findings of this research.</p>

<p>Risk is increasingly used as the basis for decisions by plant asset owners who are seeking to lower O&amp;M costs without compromising availability. System owners need easy access to up-to-date information that informs risk evaluation and mitigation. In addition,
 there is a need to efficiently communicate this risk in a form that is understood by a range of stakeholders.</p>
<p>In 2014-15, EPRI has responded to this need for steam turbines and generators by developing the concept for a Turbine Generator Risk Management Resource (TGRMR). This web application is a structured, searchable repository for technical information as well
 as operational experience collected by EPRI that relates to turbine generator risk. This work culminated in&nbsp;the Version 1.0 production release of TGRMR&nbsp;during 2016.</p>

<p>Despite possible restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuels will remain an important contributor to the world's power generation supply. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that global consumption of coal by power
 plants will increase by 50% between now and 2035, and global consumption of natural gas will increase by 70% over that same time period.</p>
<p>Intrinsic differences exist between coal and natural gas power plants, but they share a commonality in many of the issues that will affect their future use. These issues create a need for long-term research with three primary goals, all of which are addressed

<p>The program focuses on identifying and advancing a portfolio of advanced fossil fuel-power generation technologies with dramatically higher generating efficiencies than the current fossil fleet. These are coal- and natural gas-based technologies not commercially
 available today, including Rankine cycles with steam temperatures exceeding 1200°F (650°C); closed Brayton cycles using CO<sub>2</sub> as the working fluid; integrated gasification combined-cycles (IGCCs) with gas turbine firing temperatures exceeding 2700°F
 (1500°C); oxygen-blown combustion processes; and power generation concepts based on chemical looping and fuel cells. Beginning in 2016 the portfolio was expanded to include reciprocating internal combustion engines and large-scale, non-battery energy storage
 systems such as compressed air storage that could help fossil plants meet flexible operating requirements.</p>
<p>The program's R&amp;D scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides engineering and economic information on advanced fossil power technologies to support generation asset owners’ decision-making processes;
</li><li>Serves as a source of the best-available information on the status of advanced fossil power generation technology.
</li><li>Shortens the development time for promising CO<sub>2</sub> capture technologies through the cosponsoring support of the U.S. Department of Energy National Carbon Capture Center – a &quot;plug-and-play&quot; pilot- and sub-pilot-plant-scale testing facility.
</li><li>Identifies the critical R&amp;D tasks needed for promising technologies to advance toward commercial scale.
</li></ul>
<p>The goal of this program’s research is to provide society with economic options that allow continued use of abundant fossil fuels while also addressing the environmental concerns&nbsp;attendant with those fuels.&nbsp;</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI works with the Department of Energy (DOE), the International Energy Agency, technology suppliers and developers, and numerous international R&amp;D organizations to coordinate efforts and resources. This program’s scope includes both natural gas- and coal-based
 power generation technologies that&nbsp;decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering and economic evaluations and market assessments of advanced fossil generation options help power generators screen technology options and assess the economics, expected environmental performance, and technical and economic risks of a broad range
 of technologies. </li><li>Co-sponsorship of DOE's National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) allows EPRI to have&nbsp;input on the selection of technologies tested at the center and provides EPRI with early knowledge of the test results to inform its own research.
</li><li>EPRI's &nbsp;staff support the Fossil Fleet for Tomorrow program and identify&nbsp;key technical challenges faced by individual technologies and identify logical R&amp;D pathways to surmount those challenges.

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Highlight of the program include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A comprehensive review of “novel and innovative” power generation concepts such as chemical looping and cycles that use supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as the working fluid. These reviews now form the basis of an online database of novel and innovative fossil
 power technologies accessible by members. </li><li>Presentations to policymakers, written responses to DOE “requests for information,” and other outreach activities have provided guidance to members and key power industry stakeholders on the status of advanced fossil technology research, development, and
 demonstration activities. </li><li>Continued progress in the development of high-temperature boiler and steam turbine materials for ultra-supercritical (USC) steam conditions up to 760ºC (1400ºF). Testing of the world’s first steam loop operating at these elevated temperatures in a coal-fired
 power plant was completed after more than 16,000 hours of exposure to hot flue gas. The Program 66 team is now serving as the technical leaders of the US DOE/Ohio Coal Development Office Advanced USC Component Test (ComTest) project.
</li><li>Concepts were examined to meet a proposed CO<sub>2</sub> emission limit of 1100 lb/MWhr (500 kg/MWhr) for new coal power plants, which have shown that the thermal efficiencies of such plants could be several percentage points higher than the fleet average
 of existing US coal power plants. </li></ul>

<p>International engineering-procurement-construction contractors and equipment suppliers offer construction cost databases that are constantly updated as new power projects are completed. It is very expensive for individual companies to perform annual detailed
 engineering assessments of each major generation technology – as much as several hundred thousand dollars per technology -- needed to develop performance and cost data for critical asset decisions. The industry can significantly reduce those costs by collaborating
 to get the information that they need for generation planning purposes. EPRI’s Fossil Fleet for Tomorrow program’s Engineering-Economic Evaluation project (1-106013) uses collaborative resources to produce up-to-date cost and performance estimates for current
 and emerging coal and natural gas power generation technologies. This 2017 detailed engineering project will focus on the cost and performance of&nbsp;coal gasification and natural gas-based technologies that incorporate carbon capture.</p>

<p>New power generation technologies take many years to move from concept to commercial reality. Consequently, to have advanced fossil fuel power generation options ready for commercial use in the next decade, critical research and development activities need
 to be carried out now and must be sustained in the future.</p>
<p>This project set will nurture enabling technologies which&nbsp;underpin several promising power generation options, and also advance key options by either identifying the important R&amp;D needs or by direct investment in R&amp;D projects aimed at moving technologies
 up the development ladder.</p>
<p>New learning may include increased understanding of the technical barriers of specific power generation technologies, improvements in materials that could be used in multiple advanced power generation technologies, and identification of design options which
 could increase the flexible operation capability of new fossil fuel power plants.&nbsp; A special topic to be investigated in 2017 will be the status of large-scale, non-battery energy storage technologies which could be used in conjunction with large fossil power
 plants to meet demands for variable power output. &nbsp;This will complete the investigation into this topic which was started in 2016.</p>

 of pulverized coal power plants while exhibiting equal or superior environmental performance and lower water use. Although this technology has been and is being demonstrated in several gasification plants, a number of key technological advances have also been
 identified that could contribute to increasing net plant efficiency by more than 11 percentage points while cutting the cost of electricity in half. It is key for future deployment of this technology that CO<sub>2</sub> capture strategies are integrated without

<p>Ever-increasing penetration of non-dispatchable renewable power generation to the power grids in many parts of the world have resulted in large variability in the operation of the dispatchable power components, mainly coal and gas generation. Not only does
 this relatively unpredictable changing power demand place physical stress on the plants, it also leads to inefficient operation of these assets which can result in a net increase in the specific CO2&nbsp;emission rate. In addition to stand-alone energy storage
 technologies, fossil plants with carbon capture technology could contribute to short-term storage of renewable energy by adjusting the operation of the capture process when electricity demand is very high or very low.</p>
<p>With carbon capture-enabled fossil plants available, the salient questions to be investigated are:</p>
<p>• What are the cost and performance characteristics of commercially available storage systems?</p>
<p>• What energy storage strategy best fits with carbon capture enabled fossil plants?</p>
<p>• How do energy storage-capable carbon capture processes compare with standalone technologies on a techno-economic basis?</p>

<p>Over the past decade significant research has been applied to improving both CO2 post-combustion capture (PCC) technology and fossil power plant efficiency. &nbsp;However, there still remains an opportunity to improve the integration between a fossil power plant
 and a PCC system. &nbsp;This project will examine options for &nbsp;decreasing the cost and&nbsp;improving the overall efficiency of a fossil (coal or gas) power plant with CCS. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The assets for power generation are becoming more diverse and distributed with the introduction of solar, wind,&nbsp;hydroelectric and the introduction of hydro pumped storage sites. Ownership and operation of the renewable assets is also changing which may change
 the responsible parties for operation and maintenance.&nbsp; Many renewables assets are monitored and controlled&nbsp;remotely with on-site maintenance and operation&nbsp;being overseen by&nbsp;personal that oversee over a large regional area. Profiling current practices and
 approaches to remote process control, operation, and monitoring are needed to support transitioning of the renewable assets into the&nbsp;mainstream portfolio of power generation companies and members.</p>

<p>Many combined-cycle (CC) units are being operated differently from original design and as a result, accelerated degradation of components and failures have increased.&nbsp; In addition, the baseline process control schemes&nbsp;around the Heat Recovery Steam Generator
 (HRSG) are not adequate for the changes in duty cycle and are contributing to degraded performance. For HRSGs, inadequate steam temperature and attemperator control are important areas for improved measurement and control. Other CC plants, in an effort to
 avoid HRSG damage due to poor steam temperature control, operate at reduced steam temperatures and pay a penalty in reduced thermal performance.</p>
<p>There is an industry need to demonstrate improved process control of steam temperature control and&nbsp;attemperator operation&nbsp;in an effort to reduce damage and improve thermal performance.&nbsp; This project will survey&nbsp;advanced control system strategies and select
 an approach that will be demonstrated through simulation as well as&nbsp;testing on a full-scale CC unit.&nbsp; Successful completion of this project will allow operators of CC unit’s s to determine whether improvements in steam temperature control can be cost-effective
 and lessen impact on component&nbsp;degradation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of new or emerging low cost and/or wireless sensors are available for monitoring process, equipment, or component condition. However few if any of these sensors were developed for power plant applications.&nbsp; While the idea of pervasive sensing throughout
 a plant is attractive, the cost/benefit justification is not significant enough to warrant the installation of many of the commercially available sensor systems.&nbsp; The value proposition is more attractive when the sensors are low cost and have a minimal installation
 effort (e.g. wireless) and provides data that can identify a change, issue, or fault. There is a need to select and demonstrate low cost sensors to determine usefulness in performing power generation specific measurements for more efficient operations and
 maintenance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The growth of new Combined Cycle (CC) units and increased duty cycles for the installed base of CC units has created new needs for these plants including a heightened interest in improving the operation and condition monitoring of the Heat Recovery Steam
 Generator (HRSG) portion of the plant. Many HRSG designs have limited instrumentation and employ basic process control which impacts the ability to optimize HRSG performance and assess the condition of the equipment. With an increase in duty cycle, components,
 materials, and equipment are stressed causing accelerated degradation. Additionally, rapid ramp rates tend to create greater distributions in heat and drive the process controls to irregular modes and experience more extreme oscillations in the process. To
 make improvements in process control and enact a more comprehensive condition monitoring effort of critical components within the HRSG, more instrumentation and continuous measurement of process variables are needed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On-line monitoring (OLM) of equipment provides early detection of equipment degradation and failure; and OLM&nbsp;is an expanding practice for the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are varying degrees of OLM implementation across the industry including choice of sensor types,
 selection of measurement categories, insight into data quality, and degree of data utilization. Because of the continued investment and expanding interest in OLM, there is a need to provide a current objective-based guide to support members in their efforts
 to select and implement on-line sensors along with using the data collected in an effective manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wireless sensors are appealing to power industry because of low installation cost and reduced time required for installation. Power industry has started adopting wireless sensors for monitoring power plant assets; however, there are technical and regulatory
 concerns in adopting wireless sensors for control purposes. In order to address these challenges it is important for the power industry to gather and document&nbsp;the information regarding these challenges and to understand where wireless may be used in a safe
 and secure manner.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program R&amp;D for 2017&nbsp;will maintain the focus on improvements in maintenance processes and related technologies. Specific research subject areas will include some of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying and developing advancements in condition monitoring and assessment techniques for electrical equipment.
</li><li>Documenting the process for developing a model maintenance program for a given plant system.
</li><li>Standardizing the assessment process by addressing each aspect of plant operations and maintenance and providing an assessment tool in which policy, process, and execution can be evaluated without relying on the assessor’s experience and objectivity.
</li><li>Developing a comprehensive configuration management guideline that addresses maintaining design requirements, drawings, procedures, and documentation throughout the life of the plant.
</li><li>Developing a guideline to implement an equipment reliability program for a fossil generation organization that may be experiencing changes in its mission profile.
</li><li>Performing a comparative analysis of the two major approaches to asset management in the UK and the US to determine strengths and weakness of each approach and where each would best apply, as well as comparing these two equipment reliability programs to
 the major asset management standards -- namely AP 913 and ISO55000/PAS55. </li><li>Developing a guideline for electromagnetic signature measurement and detection.
</li><li>Conducting new research testing and demonstrations that enhance and advance smart monitoring and diagnostics (Smart M&amp;D) capabilities.

<p>There is a growing interest in power industry to remotely monitor power plant assets for anomaly detection. Electromagnetic Signature Analysis (EMSA) is a non-intrusive monitoring system that can be used for detecting arcing, sparking and other type of electrical
 anomalies in generator. EPRI document # 3002000102 discuss about EMSA technique, however since then there are several developments related to the technique and instrumentation. Revised guidance is needed for measurement and measurement instruments for electromagnetic
 signatures.</p>

<p>Throughout the past few years, EPRI has developed numerous fossil industry reports/guidelines that describe and define Equipment Reliability (ER) processes, good practices and program. These guidelines provide information to assist fossil power generation
 organizations with developing, assessing and implementing ER process and program enhancements. The guidance includes some information regarding considerations for scaling an ER program for varying power generation units. However, the previous research results
 primarily provided information for large coal fired units.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Combustion modifications should be viewed as the first step in any emissions control strategy. Recent and impending regulations, such as the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS), the Effluent Limitation Guidelines
 (ELG), and the European Industry Emissions Directive (IED), will make an even stronger case to deploy cost-effective combustion-based controls for not only the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx), but also as part of a holistic approach for cost-effective reduction
 of SO<sub>3</sub>, mercury and other air toxics, unburned carbon, and effluent treatment.</p>
<p>Forced outages due to fireside corrosion, circumferential cracking, and deposition of ash (e.g., slagging and fouling), which in many cases are significantly exacerbated by low-NOx operation, remain a costly issue. As coal plants shift to lower-cost/lower-quality
 coals, innovative and cost-effective solutions are&nbsp;needed to maintain boiler tube reliability.</p>
<p>Two general issues addressed in the EPRI’s Combustion and Coal Quality Impacts program (Program 71) include combustion and fuels impacts on boiler tube life, and impacts of combustion modifications and fuel quality on emissions. Both of these issues require
 an understanding of fuel quality considerations; accurate measurement and control of coal and air flow to individual burners; and improved performance of mills, burners, and other critical combustion -related hardware. This program provides the knowledge and
 resources needed to develop, demonstrate, and apply cost-effective combustion-based solutions to resolve these and other combustion- and fuels-related issues.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Combustion and Coal Quality Impacts Program focuses on a holistic approach to combustion and fuel quality impacts, including emissions, performance, and reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding a single forced outage due to fireside corrosion, circumferential cracking, or slagging and fouling is important to plant operation and reliability.
</li><li>Optimization of the combustion process can enable improved performance of downstream environmental controls. For example; lowering of furnace gas temperatures may substantially reduce mercury, as well as CO<sub>2</sub> (through improved boiler efficiency),
 and reduce SO<sub>3 </sub>oxidation through the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. Lower NOx levels entering the SCR serve to reduce reagent consumption (lowering operating costs and benefitting mercury oxidation) and extend catalyst life.
</li><li>Quantification of the increased operating costs associated with lower-quality coals can enable informed decisions on acceptable blend ratios and fuel specifications, to be balanced against savings in fuel costs.
</li></ul>
<p>Program 71 benefits the power industry and public at large by improving the reliability of fossil-based power generation (e.g., by reducing boiler tube failures), and reducing emissions.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Projects will help mitigate fireside corrosion and other operability issues in low-NO<sub>x</sub> systems; develop and demonstrate cost-effective emissions controls through combustion modifications; and assess the impacts of coal quality on emissions, performance,
 and reliability. The general approach is to develop and demonstrate cost-effective solutions to key issues, conduct comprehensive demonstrations, correlate data, and provide ample technology transfer through the publication of best practices, technical updates,
 and user-led forums (webcasts, meetings, and workshops).</p>

<p>Cost-effective solutions are needed to reduce the number of costly forced outages stemming from fireside corrosion, circumferential cracking, slagging and fouling, and other boiler tube impacts consequential to low-NOx operation and fuel quality considerations.
 This will entail the ability to quantify the tradeoffs between savings in fuel, NOx reduction, load cycling, etc. against the cost of tube failures and other operability issues. For example: Will the savings achieved by using a lower cost fuel or blend, or
 by achieving a lower NOx level, or by increasing the rate of load cycling, outweigh the negative impact on boiler tube life, and the increased probability of early boiler tube failures?</p>
<p>In addition to combustion and fuel quality considerations, this Project Set will continue its assessment of utilization of boiler tube coatings. &nbsp;Although weld overlays are a proven method of alleviating fireside corrosion, associated problems with circumferential
 cracking may be exacerbated.&nbsp; Accordingly, holistic understanding of potential solutions and trade-offs are needed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This Project Set also assesses the use of gas co-firing as a method of not only increasing fuel flexibility, but of a way to minimize operability impacts and reducing emissions.</p>

<p>Utility fossil fuel boilers are designed to meet performance guarantees based on a “specified range” of fuel properties. With continued competitive pressures, pulverized coal fired units have or are planning to switch to lower priced coals and blends which
 may substantially alter fuel properties from the original design. This may result in impaired plant performance caused from ash deposition issues (slagging and fouling) and fireside corrosion. To minimize these impacts on Boiler tube life and reliability,
 understanding the consequences of changes in fuel properties and/or blends is critical. &nbsp;Current prediction techniques and tools are limited for certain coal types and do not include the non-additive fuel interactions or boiler operating parameters when firing
 blends, leading to inaccurate predictions. Therefore, there is a need to develop and validate the next generation expert advisory tools which provide reliable predictions depending on the boiler design, operational conditions and fuel properties.</p>

<p>Combustion modifications are the most cost-effective first-line approach to reducing emissions—primarily of NOx but also mercury and other air toxics, sulfur trioxide (SO<sub>3</sub>), CO, and unburned carbon. This project set will assess emissions reductions
 that are achievable with combustion modifications in a holistic manner by considering fuel quality, boiler design, flexible boiler operating modes, as well as constraints imposed by other site-specific factors.</p>
<p>In addition to emissions reduction in the combustion process itself, this project set will also assess the impacts of combustion modifications and fuel quality on downstream environmental controls. For example, consideration will be given to the impacts
 of furnace exit gas temperature (FEGT) on mercury oxidation and SO<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;formation across the SCR, and total emissions impacts on ESP, baghouse, FGD, sorbents, as well as wastewater treatment and solids disposal systems.</p>
<p>This project also will also evaluate (1) the application of advanced sensors and monitors and their benefit when used to optimize the overall combustion process, and (2) strategic use of gas co-firing as a cost-effective means of lowering emissions.</p>

<p>Identification of optimum operating scenarios at coal plants requires the ability to evaluate potential tradeoffs between the boiler and different pollution control systems. For example, the increased deployment of scrubbers for SO<sub>2</sub> control, has
 resulted in many utilities burning a broader range of lower cost coals, or coal blends, many of which have a higher sulfur content. As a result, operational efficiency tradeoffs can arise between boiler operations and achieving compliance for multiple pollutant
 species. Consequently, a need exists for a holistic methodology that enables utilities to determine the least overall cost approach for maintaining NOx, CO, Hg, and SO<sub>3</sub> emissions compliance through both boiler and SCR operations, while also taking
 into account potential cost impacts that may be encountered with different operating scenarios (i.e. lower furnace water wall wastage from deep staging with higher sulfur fuels). In support of this effort, necessary tools will ultimately be developed and assessed
 for identifying optimum boiler and SCR operating conditions.</p>
<p>The methodology will not only take into account potential tradeoffs between boiler staging versus SCR inlet NOx levels and reagent consumption for achieving a target NOx emission level, but impacts on mercury oxidation due to changes in fly ash UBC levels,
 flue gas ammonia concentrations at the SCR inlet, SCR inlet temperature, as well as flue gas SO<sub>3</sub> concentrations.</p>
<p>Given the broad shift in coal plants from base load dispatch, to a cycling response to system load demand, advanced measurements and integration with optimization technologies will also be investigated. The goal of these investigations will be to identify
 cost effective approaches capable of providing enhanced dynamic boiler fuel/air control capability in response to changing loads with varying mill patterns and operating conditions.<em></p>

<p>Boiler criteria pollutant emissions (NOx, CO, SOx, particulates), and trace toxics (mercury, HCl) are a function of coal properties, boiler design, as well as boiler operating parameters, as well as the ability to optimize the boiler fuel/air distribution.
 Trade-offs frequently can arise between minimization of criteria pollutants and overall boiler performance, which will be assessed using case studies and other means. The ultimate goal will be to benchmark emissions performance associated with optimum boiler
 operating conditions as a function of coal type and boiler design based on ability to optimize controllable combustion parameters (mill performance, fuel/air distribution, etc.) to better enable identification of optimum boiler operational strategies.</p>
<p>This project will also examine future emerging technology options, such as ultra-low NOx burners, combustion additives, as well as other enhanced combustion technologies that do not have a well-documented application history within the coal-fired boiler
 utility industry. These technologies will be assessed through (1) maintenance of an advanced NOx control website, which summarizes pertinent findings from conferences, journals, and a review of patent applications and awards, (2) assessment of advanced coal
 cleaning methods, (3) laboratory or field evaluations of new hardware or combustion enhancement additives, as well as (4) assessment of the performance and accuracy of new combustion diagnostic tools such as TDLs for SO<sub>3</sub>, NO, and other gaseous species.<em></p>

<p>MATS (mercury and air toxics) regulations will require coal-fired power plants to not only meet very stringent limits for filterable particulate matter (FPM), but to do so with increased PM loading and difficult-to-capture materials. FPM limits will be achieved
 with either ESPs or baghouses. Future regulations may require even lower FPM limits or inclusion of condensables. The industry needs R&amp;D to evaluate and improve the performance of these technologies, including:</p>
<p><strong>ESPs:</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>two areas seem to affect PM and opacity compliance with ESPs, first is normalization of deviance for maintenance practices and second, is that some&nbsp;electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are or became undersized because
 of changes in plant operational changes to meet envirnmental regulations like MATS. For instance, ESPs are being used to collect an ash with significantly different properties than coal fly ash alone, or greater PM loading than originally designed. These situations,
 along with the desire to reduce or eliminate SO<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;flue gas conditioning in plants that use activated carbon injection for mercury control, will require the ESP to be optimized or upgraded. If the ESP well maintained and with good mechanical condition,
 significant improvements in ESP performance may be realized by retrofit of advanced power supplies, improvements in inlet flue gas distribution and/or reduction in air in-leakage, or other methods to condition the incoming dust laden flue gas. Understanding
 the impact of sorbent use on ESP performance is a key parameter that will indicate the extent of margin required for the ESP to perform at the required removal efficiency to remain compliant.</p>
<p><strong>Baghouses:</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Baghouses (<em>aka</em>&nbsp;fabric filters) are deployed to realize low FPM emissions independent of fuel properties, and for compliance with MATS limits associated with HCl, mercury, and other trace metals. However,
 the addition of sorbents changes the particulate properties significantly. These changes can impact bag life and pressure drop, leading to increased cost and energy penalties. Research is needed to develop countermeasures and new bag materials that can operate
 under different conditions associated with hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) control.</p>
<p><strong>Condensables</strong>: Although not regulated at this point in time, it is in the interest of the power industry to assess recent available data, with the objective of establishing trends between condensable particulate matter (CPM) measurements
 and plant type, fuel type, AQC systems, Method used, etc. &nbsp;CPM measurement methods and agreement regarding what needs to be included in the definition of total CPM should also be included in this assessment. Solutions for reduction of CPM with current technologies
 can then be identified.</p>

<p>Can the existing particulate control device fleet meet the needs of the current and upcoming regulations? Two areas seem to affect&nbsp;particulate matter, opacity and multi-pollutant&nbsp;compliance with ESPs. First,&nbsp;many plants are forced to consider normalization
 of deviance for prioritizing equipment maintenance. Second,&nbsp;changes in plant operation&nbsp;due to plant dispatch, fuel quality or&nbsp;to meet environmental regulations like MATS impose greater demand on the particulate control device than original design. For instance,
 ESPs are being used to collect an ash with significantly different properties than coal fly ash alone, or to collect a greater PM loading than&nbsp;designed for. These situations, along with the desire to reduce or eliminate SO<sub>3</sub> flue gas conditioning
 in plants that use activated carbon injection for mercury control, often requires the&nbsp;PM control device&nbsp;to be upgraded. If the ESP is&nbsp;in good mechanical condition, significant improvements in ESP performance may be realized by retrofit of advanced power supplies,
 improvements in inlet flue gas distribution and/or reduction in air in-leakage,&nbsp;along with&nbsp;methods to condition the incoming dust laden flue gas if so needed. Understanding the impact of sorbent use on ESP performance is a key parameter that will indicate
 the extent of margin required for the ESP to perform at the required removal efficiency to remain compliant.</p>

<p>U.S. power plants are required to measure particulate emissions in stack gases to obtain and comply with air permits, other regulations and to provide emissions data for state and federal emissions inventories. In addition, some local governments have required
 facilities not only to monitor solid (filterable) particulate emissions, but also to test for Condensable Particulate Matter (CPM), which consists of species that are gaseous at stack temperatures but that may condense into a liquid or solid form after release
 from the stack at ambient conditions.</p>
<p>Information is not readily available on how many U.S. power plants are currently required to comply with CPM limits. In 2006, EPRI surveyed recently permitted coal-fired units with emission limits established under best available control technology (BACT)
 and lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) requirements. Of those facilities with PM limits that included condensable PM (about half of the 66 units listed), the total PM10 limits ranged from 0.012 to 0.05 pounds per million British Thermal Units (lb/MMBtu).
 The report noted that while limits that included only filterable particulate matter (FPM) appeared to be trending downward over time, there was no such trend for PM limits that included both filterable and condensable PM. It is anticipated that changes to
 U.S. regulations will require measurement and reporting of&nbsp;CPM in the near future. In 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to implement the new source review (NSR) program for PM2.5. The rule requires CPM to be considered
 in NSR actions on or after January 2011 if the facility is located in areas designated as nonattainment or attainment/unclassifiable for the PM10 or PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The designation of nonattainment areas and the process
 of development of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) is still in progress. EPA has also indicated that CPM must be considered for air permits that include PM10 and PM2.5 issued under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program.</p>

<p>In order to minimize the costs of complying with emissions regulations, development and testing is needed for controls of air toxics and acid gases that are cost-effective, have lower operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) issues, and have fewer balance-of-plant
 (BOP) impacts than current offerings. Research is needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that emission limits can be met continuously, especially during fuel changes, startup, shutdown, load-following, and upset conditions
</li><li>Ensure that solutions exist for lower-quality fuels (e.g., high ash, high SO<sub>2</sub>)
</li><li>Ensure that BOP issues such as corrosion, impact on flyash salability or landfills, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) effluent are addressed for plants adding halogens, chemical additives,and sorbents
</li><li>Ensure that the effect of oxygen reduction potential (ORP) on “re-emissions” chemistry of elemental mercury and selenium partitioning from the FGD effluent is understood, and re-emissions are minimized. Also, ensuring maximum mercury oxidation across the
 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit. </li><li>Document long-term performance of all available control options </li><li>Continue development and demonstration of more cost-effective chemical additives, sorbents, mercury oxidants and novel approaches
</li><li>Provide guidance for properly controlling and integrating power plant emissions control equipment to comply with regulatory limits with minimal overall BOP impacts.

 during these transient periods and their impacts on chemistry related to both SO<sub>2</sub> capture and other air toxics are not well understood. For the utility industry to reliably meet regulations in air toxics controls and effluent discharges while minimizing

<p>SCR mercury oxidation continues to be a key focus among members as a “co-benefit” technology. In addition to reducing NOx, SCR catalysts also oxidize mercury, facilitating mercury removal downstream in a wet FGD system.&nbsp; However, SCR mercury oxidation performance
 is highly sensitive to multiple parameters, including ammonia and halogen concentrations in the flue gas.&nbsp; More data are needed to characterize mercury oxidation performance and deactivation of catalysts in real-world operating scenarios. The data will contribute
 to the development of catalyst management strategies, as well as predictive methods, both of which aid utilities in meeting MATS compliance goals.</p>

<p>Better understanding of FGD chemistry will enable improved capture of mercury and other air toxics, thereby allowing easier yet cost effective compliance of air pollution control mandates, such as MATS.&nbsp; In addition, this will also enable achievement of
 better quality effluent discharge to the wastewater treatment system, resulting in easier compliance with water regulation such as the Effluent limitation guidelines (ELG).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously in this project and in other EPRI-funded research, it has been determined that mercury, selenium, and other trace elements in coal are captured at varying percentages by wet FGD systems. It has also been determined that a parameter called oxidation-reduction
 potential (ORP) in the FGD slurry can have a direct or indirect impact on the control of some trace elements across the FGD systems.</p>
<p>There is no quantitative theoretical or empirical understanding of how wet FGD design and operation can be varied to control ORP at desired levels. Data collection at full-scale wet FGD systems and further bench scale investigations have helped better understand
 the parameters that control the ORP levels in wet FGD systems and that correspondingly impact sulfite oxidation, mercury phase partitioning, mercury re-emissions, and manganese oxidation and phase partitioning. Future efforts need to focus on how to best “tune”
 the FGD Chemistry to optimize capture and fixation of toxic materials with minimum impact on wastewater treatment operations, by-product utilization or disposal.</p>

<p>SCR systems have become a major component in the operation of most fossil fired power plants.&nbsp; Accordingly, there is a need to implement best practices and resolve key operability issues to reduce costs and maximize SCR system performance. In addition, in
 anticipation of more stringent NO<sub>x</sub> limits while simultaneously capitalizing on mercury co-benefits, methods of lowering SCR outlet NO<sub>x</sub> levels from both existing and new SCR systems—such as improved reagent/NO<sub>x</sub> mixing upstream
 of the catalyst, advanced instrumentation and control, and improved catalyst formulations—need to be demonstrated. Issues associated with lower-quality fuels (which may contain high levels of arsenic phosphorous or sulfur) need to be resolved.&nbsp; As flexible
 operation becomes more common for most units, SCR operation will need to be extended to load ranges significantly lower than originally designed.</p>

<p>Identification of optimum operating scenarios at coal plants requires a holistic assessment so as to evaluate potential tradeoffs between different systems. For example, the increased deployment of scrubbers for SO<sub>2</sub> control, has resulted in many
 utilities burning a broader range of lower cost coals, or coal blends, many of which have a higher sulfur content. As a result, operational efficiency tradeoffs can arise between boiler operations and achieving compliance for multiple pollutant species. Consequently,
 a need exists for a holistic methodology that enables utilities to determine the least overall cost approach for maintaining NOx, CO, Hg, and SO<sub>3</sub> emissions compliance through both boiler and SCR operations, while also taking into account potential
 cost impacts that may be encountered with different operating scenarios (i.e. lower furnace water wall wastage from deep staging with higher sulfur fuels). In support of this effort, necessary tools will ultimately be developed and assessed for identifying
 optimum boiler and SCR operating conditions.</p>
<p>The methodology will not only take into account potential tradeoffs between boiler staging versus SCR inlet NOx levels and reagent consumption for achieving a target NOx emission level, but impacts on mercury oxidation due to changes in fly ash UBC levels,
 flue gas ammonia concentrations at the SCR inlet, SCR inlet temperature, as well as flue gas SO<sub>3</sub> concentrations.</p>
<p>Given the broad shift in coal plants with SCR systems from base load dispatch to cycling response to system load demand, advanced measurements will also be investigated with the goal of providing enhanced SCR control capability that can better respond to
 changing SCR inlet NOx profiles, reagent and NOx reduction requirements, etc.</p>

<p>SCR catalyst management continues to be a key focus in the industry, covering both deNOx and mercury oxidation performance. SCR owners must choose between OEM and regenerated catalyst options, as well as advanced mercury oxidation formulations. Catalyst
 performance and deactivation data are needed to make timely, cost-effective catalyst replacement decisions. Sufficient independent laboratory capacity for performing catalyst activity measurements (using existing EPRI guidelines) is critical for providing
 deactivation data. In addition, methods are desired for independently (or internally) developing catalyst replacement recommendations based on the data.</p>
<p>SCR O&amp;M also continues to be a key priority.&nbsp; Proper design and maintenance of catalyst cleaning systems, LPA screens, control instrumentation, and reagent storage/feed systems can significantly reduce the costs of SCR operation.</p>

<p>Increased variability in commercial power and relative fuel prices are forcing changes to fossil asset dispatching. In addition, increased deployment of renewable generation over the next decade will force coal plants to provide system load-balancing services.
 Specific operational changes expected for coal plants include two-shifting, high ramp rates, high unit turndown, and reserve shutdown. Performance of environmental control equipment, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, represents a limiting
 factor in achieving necessary operational flexibility for optimum generation dispatch. Given these limitations, there is a need to demonstrate low-cost operational strategies that can increase asset dispatch flexibility, while maintaining environmental control
 equipment performance, and minimizing the short- and long-term impact on system costs and equipment damage.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Coal-fired power plants increasingly need robust, accurate, and certifiable continuous emissions monitors (CEMs) for mercury, particulate matter (PM), acid gases, and -- potentially -- selenium. Experience with continuous mercury monitors (CMMs) remains
 limited, and their operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) are labor-intensive. PM monitors are not yet routinely used, and their calibration currently is cumbersome, while hydrochloric acid (HCl) is not measured continuously.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to a number of power companies are instruments that continuously measure solids (filterable) and aerosols (condensable PM, acid gases (e.g., HCl, and hydrogen cyanide [HCN]), and ammonia in post-flue gas desulfurization [FGD] stack
 conditions).</p>
<p>Enabling technology needs for these species include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling techniques that lend themselves to the very low pollutant concentrations that may be required by applicable air standards. Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) limits, especially for mercury;
</li><li>Acceptable ways to calibrate PM monitors at plants with wet stacks without having to disrupt the operation of the wet SO<sub>2</sub> control.
</li><li>Direct measurement of mass emissions to overcome the uncertainty of indirect measurements as PM characteristics change.
</li><li>Emission measurements for gas-fired generation, including ultra-low NOx and CO measurements for combined cycle units.
</li><li>Utilization of continuous monitoring instrumentation for process control of emission control technologies.
</li><li>Operation and maintenance practices for mercury CEMs that enable operators to gather&nbsp;lessons learned for other&nbsp;CMMs users.
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Continuous Emissions Monitoring program (Program 77) helps members evaluate and implement monitoring options to meet measurement needs using robust, accurate, and easy-to-operate instruments. Benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save months of plant instrument technician and environmental engineer time needed to make newly procured monitoring technologies work.
</li><li>Prepare for anticipated mercury measurement requirements below today’s proven quantization levels, as well as PM measurements (filterable and condensable) as surrogates for non-mercury metal hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).
</li><li>Optimize NOx and sulfur trioxide (SO<sub>3</sub>) control operations, or flue gas conditioning for electrostatic precipitator (ESP) performance, via
<em>in situ</em> continuous measurement systems for ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), SO<sub>3</sub>, and sulfuric acid.
</li><li>Reserach the ability and applicability on stacks to install&nbsp;advanced “sensors-on-a-chip” for power plant applications.
</li></ul>
<p>Program 77 research benefits the power industry and public at large by enabling reliable power plant emissions monitoring, resulting in reductions in emissions of continuously monitored pollutants such as mercury and other trace metals, particulates, SO<sub>2</sub>,
 and HCl and other acid gases.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program promotes the development and validation of accurate, robust, and low-maintenance CEMs monitoring and reporting capabilities. It has a near-term emphasis on continuous particulate mass, HCl, and measuring&nbsp;low mercury concentrations. Based on
 similar technologies and skills, the program also develops and validates gas monitoring systems intended for optimizing pollutant control operation. Looking ahead to further cost constraints, it identifies, develops, and demonstrates innovative measurement
 systems with the potential to significantly reduce CEMs costs in the longer term. Some components of this effort will be performed jointly with the Sampling and Analytical Methods project (P-59.002) in EPRI’s Environment Sector.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s leadership in identifying and resolving performance and O&amp;M issues with CEMs is recognized by the power industry, CEMs equipment suppliers, and regulatory agencies, especially the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This recognition is demonstrated
 annually by the successful CEMs User Group meetings organized by EPRI, which attracts strong participation by the EPA, vendors/exhibitors, and users.</p>
<p>A number of EPA decisions in on mercury monitors in recent years have relied in part on EPRI’s R&amp;D findings, as presented to the EPA by industry. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPA approval of the sorbent trap method for continuous mercury monitoring and use as a reference method.
</li><li>EPA approval to use an instrumental reference method in lieu of the complex, costly, slow-turnaround-time Ontario Hydro batch method.
</li><li>Accelerated development of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable calibration procedures for CMMs.
</li><li>Determination of CMMs' abilities to measure low mercury concentrations, leading instrument vendors to develop and demonstrate monitors capable of measuring accurately the very low concentrations expected after implementation of MACT standards.
</li><li>Proposed methodology for calibrating particulate mass emission monitors that avoids the need to exceed emission limits for other pollutants.
</li><li>Strong positive response by the host power station and instrument suppliers to a PM monitor troubleshooting and development test platform organized and managed by EPRI.
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program R&amp;D for 2017 will focus on completing efforts to demonstrate the capabilities of CMMs to measure very low mercury concentrations, especially in the presence of bromine, and to operate with less-intensive staff demands; finding and assessing reliable
 and accurate CEMs for HCl; revisiting the search for methods to measure condensables in wet stacks without artifacts; and completing field tests of techniques to calibrate continuous PM monitors without unusual processes. Continuing efforts to reduce uncertainty
 in flue gas flow measurements and CO<sub>2</sub> in support of greenhouse gas emissions reductions will be demonstrated. Additional efforts may continue the development and demonstration of continuous
<em>in situ</em> spatial measurements of NH<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub> in the boiler back end for process control.</p>

<p>Many electric generating units (EGUs) are required to monitor particulate matter (PM) emissions using continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS).&nbsp; Under the proposed MACT rules many more are expected to install PM monitors.&nbsp; The current PM CEMS calibration
 procedure, Performance Specification 11 (PS-11), requires simultaneous sampling of stack emissions with PM CEMS and EPA Reference Method 5 (M5) over a range of concentrations attained by adjusting plant load and/or modifying (i.e., de-tuning) PM controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PM characteristics such as particle size distribution (PSD) may change during load adjustments or de-tuning, and these changes may affect the measurement in the PM CEMS monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; More specifically, if the plant operated in a way that would cause a significant
 change in the PM characteristics reaching the stack, this could affect the existing correlation curve for the PM CEMS.</p>
<p>In addition, power plants are more often operating out of their “regular” operating mode.&nbsp; This could be due to more cycling, longer low load operation and quicker ramping rates due to dispatch needs.&nbsp; These scenarios could also produce PM with different
 characteristics and affect the existing correlation curve for the PM CEMS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some electric generating units (EGUs) are required to monitor particulate matter (PM) emissions using continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS). Many more expect they will have to install PM monitors under proposed MACT rules. Currently, simultaneous
 EPA manual reference method tests (EPA Reference Method 5) must be used to calibrate and audit these PM CEMS, following EPA Performance Specification 11 guidelines (PS-11).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The current PM CEMS calibration procedure, Performance Specification 11 (PS-11), requires simultaneous sampling of stack emissions with PM CEMS and EPA Reference Method 5 (M5) over a range of concentrations attained by adjusting plant load and/or modifying
 (i.e., de-tuning) PM controls. These tests are complicated, time consuming, and expensive to perform.&nbsp; The need to modify plant operating procedures to achieve a range of PM concentrations for calibrating PM CEMS represents a significant burden to plant operations.&nbsp;
 There is a clear need for better methods to calibrate and audit these PM CEMS, providing sufficient concentration range while eliminating complicated modifications to plant operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Under other EPRI-sponsored efforts two alternative PM CEMS calibration methods have been developed.&nbsp; The first and the furthest along in development is the quantitative aerosol generator (QAG).&nbsp; The QAG produces precisely known quantities of PM aerosols.&nbsp;
 The QAG nebulizes a salt solution which acts as the surrogate for the PM in the stack.&nbsp; The second alternative method is the portable particulate matter calibration system (PPMC).&nbsp; The PPMC also produces known quantities of PM aerosols but instead of using
 a salt solution a slurry of fly ash and or fly ash substitute is atomized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s promulgated Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) require coal-fired electric utilities to monitor for non-mercury hazardous air pollutant (non-Hg HAP) metals. One option for meeting this requirement
 is to monitor particulate matter (PM) emissions as a surrogate for non-Hg HAP metals with a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). Current PM CEMS calibration procedures (PS-11) require simultaneous sampling of stack emissions with PM CEMS and EPA Reference
 Method 5 (M5) over a range of concentrations attained by adjusting plant load and/or modifying PM controls. These tests are complicated, time consuming and expensive to perform. The need to modify plant operating procedures to achieve a range of PM concentrations
 for calibrating PM CEMS represents a significant burden to plant operations. In some cases, an adequate PM concentration range cannot be defined during the short-term PS-11 test, which can restrict the operating limits of the coal fired power plant (CFPP)
 to unnecessarily low levels. (The restriction is due to the PS-11 limitation on the upper end of the correlation, see PS-11 §8.8.) An improved calibration approach that provides sufficient concentration ranges while eliminating complicated modifications to
 plant operations is clearly needed.</p>

<p>On February 16, 2012, EPA issued National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal-and Oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units. Since proposing the rule in May 2011, EPA has typically referred to this as the Mercury and Air Toxics
 Standards (MATS) rule.&nbsp; The MATS rule established emissions standards for new and existing coal- and oil-fired electric generating units (EGUs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MATS rule establishes emission limits for mercury (Hg) and provides two approaches for demonstrating continuous compliance.&nbsp; The MATS rule also establishes hydrogen chloride (HCl) emission limits for coal- and oil-fired units.&nbsp; Many, but not all, coal-fired
 units will have the option of monitoring and complying with an SO<sub>2</sub> limit in lieu of HCl.&nbsp; However, in the MATS rule, oil-fired units must monitor and comply with an HCl emission limit. For the heavy metals (non-Hg metals) emission limit, the MATS
 rule provides several compliance options, including the installation and operation of a particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS).&nbsp; The MATS rule presents significant monitoring challenges to EPRI members simply because the emission
 concentrations that need to be measured are quite low.</p>

<p>In recent years EPRI has been quantifying heat rate improvements using plant-installed Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) instrumentation to access potential heat rate improvements. Recently a series of best practices were proposed following a
 “super-RATA” field test in 2015 and it was found that the stack gas volumetric flow rate measurements contributed the most significant uncertainty to the heat rate calculation. Therefore there is a need to further improve stack flow measurements by reducing
 calibration uncertainties.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Management of coal combustion products (CCPs) is expected to shift from predominantly disposal to predominantly beneficial use over the next several years. Disposal of CCPs is increasingly expensive, a potential long-term liability, and subject to growing
 public opposition. Conversely, beneficial use can be a source of revenue, often eliminates long-term liabilities by incorporation into new products, and is looked upon favorably by the public.&nbsp;The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) exempted most beneficial
 use applications from the CCP disposal rule published in 2015, providing further incentive to move away from disposal and toward use.&nbsp;In addition to freshly produced CCPs,&nbsp;ponds and landfills provide an immense resource of stored raw materials going forward
 that has only recently begun to be tapped. However, many challenges exist to increasing CCP use, including: varying CCP quality due to changes in plant dispatch and operations;&nbsp;impacts of air emissions controls for mercury and acid gases on CCP quality; increasing
 production of flue gas desulfurization gypsum exceeding the needs of the wallboard market; increasing volumes of spray dryer by-products that are difficult to use in conventional applications; and processing of CCPs stored in ponds and landfills.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Coal Combustion Product Use program builds on years of investigation into current and new uses&nbsp;for CCPs. With greater certainty following the publication of the CCP disposal rule, the focus in 2017 is on technology
 development, including testing to evaluate the engineering and environmental performance of promising applications for CCPs. A second area of research will focus on mitigating&nbsp;changes in CCP quality that may negatively impact their potential for use, such
 as sorbents injected for air emissions controls.&nbsp;A significant new long-term research direction&nbsp;is the characterization and processing of CCPs stored in ponds and landfills for targeted applications. To facilitate acceptance in the marketplace, the research
 will coordinate closely with marketers and end-users, and provide communication vehicles for technical information for industry, regulators, and the public. The technical results from this program are highly transferable to international utilities.</p>

<li>
<p>Minimize CCP disposal costs, which are expected to increase significantly under new regulatory requirements;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Limit long-term liabilities associated with operating and maintaining large disposal sites;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Retain or earn new revenue by selling CCPs into a variety of acceptable markets;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Supporting sustainable and low cost construction and agricultural practices using CCPs in lieu of virgin raw materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The program provides information on CCP quality and the engineering and environmental performance of CCP uses. To maximize the benefit of the research, EPRI collaborates with marketers and end-users, trade organizations such as the American Coal Ash Association
 (ACAA), and government entities such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Highway Administration, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to address significant technical barriers to CCP use at the local and national level. The work will
 be performed using a combination of base research for broad applications and targeted projects for specific applications.</p>
<p>The scope of the program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Established CCPs products, such as fly ash in cement and concrete products and FGD gypsum in wallboard;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Geotechnical applications, such as road base, structural fills, mine fills, and waste stabilization;&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Products using “off-spec” CCPs, such as spray dryer solids, and ash containing activated carbon or elevated sodium levels;</p>
</li><li>
<p>New or growing technologies, such a geopolymers, alternative cements, asphalt, and agricultural applications;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Communications on the engineering, environmental, and life-cycle benefits of CCP uses.</p>

<p>The chemical and geotechnical properties of CCPs are a key consideration in beneficial use applications.&nbsp; Increasingly, CCP properties are changing in response to changes in air emissions controls under the Mercury and Air Toxics regulations.&nbsp; Changes in
 plant dispatch can significantly impact CCP consistency.&nbsp; In addition, utilities are increasingly seeking to use CCPs previously stored in ponds and landfills.&nbsp; In many cases, these changes will result in CCPs that do not meet typical specifications for use
 in concrete, wallboard, and other construction applications.</p>
<p>In order to increase or even maintain current levels of CCP use will require thorough knowledge of factors impacting CCP quality given the broader trends within the electric power industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; This information can be used to judge the impact of changes in
 CCP quality for various use opportunities, to develop operational approaches to improving CCP quality and consistency, and to identify uses that are not sensitive to CCPs of varying quality. This includes assessment of beneficiation technologies to improve
 CCP quality, and recovery of CCPs from&nbsp; storage in landfills and ponds.</p>
<p>The information developed under this project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide power companies with data to evaluate the impacts of plant controls and operations on the ability to market their CCPs;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Provide methods for improving CCP marketability;</p>

<p>Power companies use about 40-45% of the CCPs produced annually. This percentage range has been relatively consistent for the last 12 years.&nbsp; Technologies for using fly ash in conventional portland cement concrete and FGD gypsum in wallboard are well established
 from both an engineering and regulatory perspective, however these uses still only accounted for less than one-third of the fly ash and FGD gypsum produced in 2014. Changes in CCP quality due to increased air emissions controls may further render some CCPs
 unsuitable for conventional uses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Development and demonstration of modified or new technologies will be needed to significantly increase use. This project will work with the use industry to identify and develop CCP use technologies, and provide third-party technical information to judge
 their engineering and environmental performance. The information developed under this project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deliver a framework for evaluating both existing and new CCP uses;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Provide participating companies with detailed engineering and environmental information for promising uses;</p>

<p>CCP use is closely tied to the markets, end-users, regulators, and public perception.&nbsp; Development of a product or technology will be of only academic interest without the support and interaction with stakeholders outside of the conventional power plant

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Users of natural-gas-powered simple-cycle (SC) and combined-cycle (CC) plants for power generation continue to benefit from the increased worldwide supply of natural gas fuel, and from the continued environmental pressure to limit the use of coal-based power
 plants. They also continue to benefit from the expected limited growth of new nuclear power generation and the greater ability of natural-gas-powered plants to operate in cycling duty to accommodate the growing deployments of wind and solar power sources.</p>
<p>The asset value of natural-gas-fired gas turbines (GT), especially in CC plants, is on the rise. But cycling and high-temperature operations can adversely affect GT component life. Life-cycle costs, premature wear, failure risks, and environmental performance
 are critical issues affecting plant performance, reliability, and cost. Improved operational flexibility can help plants address load demands even as GT and CC technologies continue to evolve, providing significant efficiency gains and relative improvements
 in installed cost. Informed decisions about technologies and plant designs are especially important because efficiency, emissions, availability, maintainability, and durability are all key selection factors.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Combined Cycle Turbomachinery program (Program 79) provides resources to address all aspects of the life management and the operational and maintenance (O&amp;M) improvements of conventional and advanced GTs.
 It also addresses all aspects of CC plant-wide integration, including specific issues relating to the steam turbine (ST) and generator for CC applications.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Members of this program can use the research to respond to the issues, challenges, and opportunities in integrating and operating CC assets in a rapidly expanding and changing power generation environment. &nbsp;They implement specific and detailed engineering
 analyses in the areas of CC turbomachinery life assessment, risk management, and improved operation and maintenance of current assets. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program research portfolio has two primary technical objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a holistic approach and perspective on all R&amp;D elements related to integrating all the equipment and systems of a CC plant.
</li><li>Address all aspects of managing CC turbomachinery assets, including life assessment, risk management, O&amp;M improvements, and technology advancements.
</li></ul>
<p>Specific technical interaction and allocation of resources between Program 79 and other EPRI programs such the CC HRSG and Balance of Plant program (Program 88) and the Steam Turbine-Generator program (Program 65) effectively utilize existing EPRI technical
 expertise and resources without duplication between programs.</p>
<p>The strategic objectives of Program 79 represent the following technical areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas turbine component life extension </li><li>Gas turbine and combined-cycle plant monitoring </li><li>Steam turbine and generators in combined-cycle plants </li><li>Combined-cycle plant integration </li><li>New combined-cycle plant designs, cycles, and upgrades </li><li>Gas turbine innovation and advancement </li></ul>
<p>Each year the program’s projects and activities are aligned with one or more strategic objectives and within a five-year plan as the GTCC power industry moves forward. P79 members receive information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant-wide integration – topics including operational flexibility and controls, performance improvement and optimization, and GT, heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and ST interaction and inter-system dependence.
</li><li>Life assessment and risk management – topics including damage detection, root cause and solutions, and monitoring and life-predicting analyses.
</li><li>O&amp;M improvements – topics including component durability and damage tracking, and repair and refurbishment guidelines.
</li><li>Technology advancements – topics including engineering and economic assessments, reliability and availability statistics of current turbomachinery RAM performance, and new and advanced equipment offerings and capabilities.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>For the last 30 years, EPRI’s GT and CC research programs have provided high-quality technical evaluations and products to support better operation and maintenance of existing assets, and provide objective, timely, life-cycle perspectives on technology choices
 and improved plant designs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model-specific repair guidelines for widely used 50/60-Hertz (Hz) machines </li><li>Replacement part procurement guidelines for D/E- and F-Class models </li><li>Compressor and rotor root-cause analysis and O&amp;M solutions </li><li>O&amp;M guidance for DLN combustor systems and segmented feed pumps </li><li>Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and CO catalyst deactivation assessment and improved emission controls tuning
</li><li>Component durability analysis and damage tracking </li><li>CC performance monitoring and recovery </li><li>GT technology comparisons, best practices, and procurement guidelines/specifications
</li><li>Lessons learned in GT/HRSG repowering </li></ul>

<p>There is a gas turbine industry-wide need to specify cost-effective state-of-the-art design features of new Combined-cycle plants for high efficiency, flexibility, maintainability and reliability.&nbsp; This need has never been greater especially in north America
 where the price of natural gas is expected to stay extremely low and the supply is expected to remain extremely high over the next decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners and operators seeking to build new generation assets and very interested in the design and construction aspects of building combined cycle plants based on advanced (H/J class) gas turbines.&nbsp; Given that US Engineering and Construction (E&amp;C) firms have
 designed and built such advanced plants, their experience that may be applicable to owners/operators may be available.&nbsp; A high quality front end engineering design (FEED) or pre-FEED report could be generated, and compared with designs based on F-class gas
 turbines from a decade ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Combined SCR/CO catalyst concepts have been&nbsp;recently introduced for simple and combined-cycle power plants as emissions continue to be a critical priority for operating these plants.&nbsp; The current and future&nbsp;requirement to cycle, ramp and fast start these
 plants has put even more pressure on the catalyst designers and manufacturers to optimize these systems and extend the useful life of the materials.&nbsp; This situation has now required that an independent evaluation be completed to more fully understand and document
 the effectiveness of these catalyst systems.</p>
<p>Recent advancements have yielded combined SCR/CO catalyst concepts, however, with the catalyst being a critical component of combined cycle operation, further evaluation is a necessity.&nbsp; This particular work will focus not only on laboratory testing but
 will conclude with full-scale testing to determine performance and deactivation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Power plant owners, operators, and maintenance managers seek new and next-generation technologies and approaches for decrease plant downtime and reduce repairs costs especially within the gas turbine flow path.&nbsp; Although gas turbine OEMs provide explicit
 maintenance intervals based on hours and starts, the industry is more fully moving towards condition-based repairs and outage management.&nbsp; Monitoring and inspecting prior to repairing and/or replacing costly gas turbine compressor, combustor and hot sections
 components has become attractive to gas turbine owners and operators in the current environment where life extension of parts is critical.</p>
<p>The latest generation of borescope inspection equipment potentially offers improvements to access engine components and to quantify related damage.&nbsp; Advanced visual borescope surface damage mapping can more fully characterize component 3-D surface damage
 using remote approaches.&nbsp; The objective of this project is to determine advanced borescope enhanced capabilities to locate and quantify damage in the gas turbine combustor, compressor and hot section flow path.</p>

<p>Operational reliability operating statistics (ORAP from SPS) indicate that gas turbines and steam turbines are the dominant contributors to unplanned outages with an unplanned unavailability of 4 to 6% for a typical plant.&nbsp; Complex, tightly integrated gas
 turbines&nbsp;in particular are subject to cascading damage from failed inlet compressor blades/vanes, combustor hardware, or hot section parts.&nbsp; Rebuilding such equipment with custom, high cost components often requires an extended outage to accommodate the long
 lead times of manufacturing new components and transport to off-site repair shops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Component stress analysis and material testing are used to address cracking in the rim attachments and the general structural integrity of gas turbines subjected to high hours
 and high starts.</p>
<p>Gas turbine rotor life is increasingly limited by damage to the disc rims and blade attachment slots.&nbsp; Developing and refining field inspection techniques capable of detecting and sizing blade rim&nbsp;attachment slot cracks without destacking rotor assemblies
 will be of great value and significance to decreasing overhaul costs and outage delays.</p>

<p>Cracking in rotating blades and loss of prime-reliant cooling are the key concerns in advanced, high-temperature designs in gas turbine hot sections.&nbsp; Maintenance of the power center-line equipment such as the gas turbine represents the largest portion of
 the combined-cycle non-fuel plant budget.&nbsp; With increasing capacity factors, fewer outage windows are available to schedule maintenance.&nbsp; A related factor&nbsp;is the long&nbsp;lead times often required to obtain new and/or refurbished costly custom&nbsp;parts such as advanced
 model-specific super-alloy hot section blades and vanes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single crystal superalloy hot section components are increasingly used in F-class and advanced gas turbines.&nbsp; A greater understanding of unique single crystal degradation mechanisms is needed to help manage risks and associated maintenance decisions.&nbsp; Noteworthy
 is the recent change of ownership in the gas turbine industry of the Alstom GT 24/26 fleet that does contain single crystal super-alloys in the hot section.&nbsp; GT 24/26 owners and operators are seeking additional options to the parts and services providers&nbsp;in

<p>The need for this reference guide is based on many conversations and discussions with combined-cycle and simple cycle gas turbine maintenance managers, engineers and especially plant operators that are&nbsp;given the task of safely controlling Dry Low NOx (DLN)
 combustion systems at all operating conditions.</p>
<p>From the beginning of DLN combustion&nbsp;technology development&nbsp;in the late 1980's, combustion dynamics (CD) have been a major driver and issue for gas turbines.&nbsp; High amplitude CD can be the symptom of a needed re-tune or can result in costly and untimely outages
 due to hardware failures.&nbsp; The issue for monitoring and site personnel is to determine what the CD data represents: sensor failure, hardware failure, re-tune need, etc.&nbsp; The purpose of this guide is to give understanding to CD through a quick-reference handbook
 giving examples and key understanding on why CD even exist and what CD mean in different situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>GE 7EA gas turbine compressors have experienced vibratory cracking and/or vane liberation failures over the recent past.</p>
<p>With ongoing examination into operational and ambient failure factors, 7EA users are in need of testing capabilities for in-situ compressor blades.&nbsp; This pinging protocol assessment is based upon current GE guidance for users and examines the best procedure
 and equipment to utilize.&nbsp; Note this protocol will not address whether a crack is present; however, the damping and frequency of resonance for each blade can aid in determine the order units in a fleet should be upgraded with the latest blades.&nbsp; Overall, this
 work will give guidance on the likelihood of blade issues for one unit verses another.</p>

<p>Many DLN gas turbines that have been through multiple hardware repair cycles have base load NOx emissions that have increased above their design value.</p>
<p>During recent years, many DLN hardware upgrades have resulted in de-ratings on units where instead of an expected 10-15 MW increase, there is a 5-15 MW decrease from original base loading.&nbsp; In some cases this is due to combustion dynamics restricting power
 output and in other cases (typically an issue for simple cycle units) NOx emissions are out of compliance, thus requiring the de-rating.&nbsp; Whether simple- or combined-cycle, the development of this cycle deck tool will allow users of 7FA units to perform root
 cause analyses without the need and delays from GE.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gas turbine owners and operators have identified inlet air filtration as a potential cost saving as combined-cycles are operating more frequently and experiencing more cycles.&nbsp; Selecting the&nbsp;most cost-effective combination of inlet air filters and water
 wash frequency&nbsp;greatly impacts&nbsp;the gas turbine performance.&nbsp; The gas turbine industry is in need of a tool that quantifies the complex interaction of filter pressure drop and particulate collection efficiency, compressor fouling and performance impacts, and
 their incremental effect on plant economics.</p>
<p>Additional refinements are anticipated as experience is gained in the application of the Air Filtration Life-Cycle Cost Optimization (AFLCO) software&nbsp;with members operating gas turbines in simple cycle and combined cycle configurations.&nbsp; Furthermore, some
 members may have the opportunity to measure ambient air particulate loading and size distribution over time and therefore refine the regional size distributions incorporated into the model.&nbsp; Additional side-by-side filter tests in the field may provide additional
 insights on how well laboratory tests model filter efficiency increases as loading and pressure drop increase. &nbsp;Other enhancements may include refining the model for compressor efficiency and dirt buildup on compressor blades and vanes.</p>

<p>For gas turbine power plants, accurate prediction of next-day output and heat rate is critical for optimizing plant dispatch order and maximizing plant revenues.</p>
<p>Dispatching of power plants is a complex, economically driven operation.&nbsp; Just as complex is gas turbine performance due to dependencies on unit condition and ambient conditions, which drives the economics of unit to unit operation.&nbsp; Thus, having the most
 up-to-date models for determining optimal dispatch is tantamount.&nbsp; This specific work is focusing on updating the Gas Turbine Performance Analyzer (GTPA) for next day forecasting for optimal dispatching based on near real-time output and heat rate capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vintage or legacy combustion turbines (e.g., Frames 5, 6 and 7) are nearing or have reached their design service lives. With additional investment, turbine life may be extended and/or performance can be improved to help meet power demand.&nbsp; The overall objectives
 of this effort are to gain a better understanding of industry best practices for managing flexible operating requirements; determine the impact on component life, cost and availability; and identify a means to monitor and control the impact on the plant.</p>
<p>Simple- and combined-cycle plants are being forced to increase their operating flexibility in order to accommodate the variability of wind and solar power generation. These plants have increased their flexibility by decreasing startup times, operating at
 higher peak capacity during high demand periods, turning down to even lower loads while complying with emission targets, and maintaining higher efficiencies during turndown and load following, while reducing the operations and maintenance costs of frequent
 starts/stops and the impact on plant availability. The experience gained by these plants in implementing their strategies is captured in case studies.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Today’s fossil power plants are tasked with flexible operations, pushing for maximum output during peak price periods, transitioning to low-load and multi-shift operation, and frequent fuel switching to take advantage of spot market opportunities. These
 practices can accelerate material damage in major power block components. New materials are being introduced for replacement of components in aging plants, in the building of higher-efficiency power plants, and in the construction of components with thinner
 walls for improved operational flexibility. Regulations on air and water quality have resulted in construction of new pollution control equipment and water management technologies that are more demanding on materials than older systems.</p>
<p>Improved knowledge of materials behavior in such environments allows for accurate prediction of remaining life, proper choice of repair strategies, and optimized material selection, fabrication, and repair. To address these needs, the Electric Power Research
 Institute’s (EPRI’s) Fossil Materials and Repair program (Program 87) provides integrated materials selection guidance, repair and welding technologies, and corrosion mitigation methods to improve equipment performance, reliability, and safety. Research is
 conducted in all areas of the fossil power plant, including the major power block (boilers, HRSGs, steam turbines, gas turbines, etc.) and the balance of plant.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Safety and availability loss due to failures are two key issues driving R&amp;D on major fossil power plant components, especially in older plants. Improved efficiency and reliability are two reasons for the selection of new materials for retrofit and new-build
 projects. EPRI’s Materials and Chemistry programs provide data on critical material degradation mechanisms, conduct materials and chemistry-related R&amp;D for advanced generation technologies, and quantify the benefits of improvements. These programs help utilities
 balance the risks and costs of the largest, most costly equipment, and focus on using new technologies to create solutions. Members of the Fossil Materials and Repair program can use the R&amp;D to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase availability through better understanding of plant materials. </li><li>Minimize -- with the goal to eliminate -- repeat failures and equipment damage, and reduce outage frequency and duration by using improved knowledge of damage mechanisms and tools for life-assessment methods.
</li><li>Reduce failures from high- and low-temperature corrosion. </li><li>Obtain in-depth knowledge of advanced ferritic and austenitic alloys and processes used to fabricate and join these alloys.
</li><li>Select appropriate weld filler metals and processes for construction and repair.
</li><li>Reduce outage time and manage maintenance costs through implementation of innovative repair techniques.
</li><li>Maximize component life through improved materials selection guidance and procurement specifications.
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Through a continuum of materials and repair guidelines, handbooks, technical projects, webcasts, position papers, and conferences/workshops, the program helps manage and reduce the operating risks associated with material degradation and failure. Projects
 develop industry-leading and scientifically based resources to aid in materials property estimates used to determine remaining component life, assess and conduct state-of-the-art repairs, decide on replacement materials, and address costly corrosion and erosion
 problems faced in real-world business settings.</p>
<p>Members of the program also benefit from direct access to the technical staff expertise, EPRI laboratories, and a worldwide research network. The program’s mission of research excellence has established EPRI as a leading organization for materials research
 for power plants. The program seeks to maximize member value through though internal EPRI collaboration with component-based programs, targeted government-sponsored research, and collaboration with US and international research organizations.</p>

<p>Increased emphasis on the treatment and removal of contaminants from power plant wastewater has gained industry attention as new effluent guidelines are now under consideration in the U.S. A key need is to reduce the total volume of water which must be treated
 by the power plant, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater is the “last stop” for water leaving the plant which needs to be treated. To create less FGD wastewater, the FGD can be “cycled-up” and/or technologies such as membranes can be used to concentrate
 waste streams.</p>
<p>These concentrated FGD brines contain high levels of halogens (chlorides, bromides, etc.), low pH values, and other solid and dissolved species. A plethora of materials options to construct treatment systems exist, ranging from alloys such as lower-cost
 stainless steels to very expensive nickel-based alloys or titanium. Non-metallic solutions such as coated steels and fiber re-enforced plastic (FRP) can also be used. The industry needs information about the mechanisms of corrosion and criteria for materials
 selection in these new environments, which currently are not well understood. &nbsp;EPRI completed a laboratory study as a basis for this materials selection in 2016 and aims to evaluate these same materials in the less controlled real-world field environment to
 validate the study conclusions.</p>

<p>Long-term creep testing and service experience have clearly shown that composition and processing within the allowed specification for Grade 91 steel can effect long-term creep strength and ductility. &nbsp;The concern over low ductility heats and the potential
 for shortened life due to notch weakening effects is a challenge to long-term life management. &nbsp;This project is addressing this challenge through the development of a metallurgical risk factor which will facilitate screening of materials on the basis of composition
 and also provide the industry enhanced guidelines for procurement of components (which has already been released in EPRI position papers on chemistry and a publically available specification document).</p>

<p>Post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) is a critical step in the application of materials in power plants. If a PWHT is conducted incorrectly, serious damage can occur including overtempering and/or anciculary damage to surrounding equipment. This is especially
 critical in creep-strength-enhanced ferritic (CSEF steels) because approaching or exceeding the intercritical temperature during PWHT results in significant degradation to creep life and long-term performance.&nbsp; The industry needs to improve PWHT to also improve
 long-term performance of CSEF steels in power plants</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The design of modern heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) and balance-of-plant (BOP) systems is a complex interrelationship between many parameters and variables. HRSGs pose a unique set of operational challenges, due in part to their rapid startup capabilities;
 high operating efficiencies; multi-pressure circuits; reheat, once-through, combined drum/once-through systems; and numerous varieties available in the basic design. Preventing HRSG tube failures (HTFs) is a priority, but complex failure paths, which are influenced
 by cycle chemistry or thermal transients, are difficult to understand and mitigate. Limited access and other complexities make inspection and repair of HRSGs very difficult.</p>
<p>Today, the design philosophy of combined-cycle plants is evolving just as the electric power industry is evolving due to an influx of renewable energy, low natural gas pricing in the United States (even as costs are much higher internationally), and environmental
 issues. Many owners of combined-cycle plants are now rethinking the concept of baseload operation and looking at cycling operation. Because current combustion turbines do not have low turndown capabilities while maintaining emission limits, the ability to
 cycle a unit is the alternate solution.</p>
<p>Cycling plants are units designed to optimize plant operations by providing rapid startups, partial loading, and short shutdowns. These frequent changes in plant operation are not easily obtained in current OEM and operating design limits. To achieve cycling
 operation, both equipment and system design have to be considered. For this reason, cycling designs should accommodate several new features not considered for baseload units. Cycling operation should ensure satisfactory operation throughout the full operating
 range of the unit. Facility or plant designs should also consider conditions when the unit is not operating. A combined-cycle plant with operating flexibility can provide start, stop, and partial-load operation to match changing demand for power. However,
 these benefits can bring added costs due to wear and tear on equipment through thermal fatigue. These added costs associated with plant cycling cannot be totally eliminated; they may be minimized but must be considered for long-term reliability.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Combined Cycle HRSG and Balance of Plant (BOP) program (Program 88) provides a complete set of technical tools to improve the performance and reliability of combined-cycle HRSGs and BOP equipment. The program
 includes a background of HRSG design and development, particularly over the last 10 years, in which HRSG designs have become remarkably complex, operating at significantly higher pressures and temperatures. It also provides a comprehensive understanding of
 available designs and tools for preparing procurement specifications for both new and used HRSG and BOP components based on past research and new technologies.</p>

<p>Fouled HRSG finned tubes continue to penalize the industry. It is thought that a severely fouled HRSG can cause a several hundred thousand dollar hit to a unit's bottom line.</p>
<p>Every plant’s annual maintenance program should include removal of HRSG gas-side deposits. Effective maintenance planning can be improved by closely monitoring specific operating parameters, such as CT backpressure, steam production and temperature (for
 each pressure level), and stack temperature, and comparing the data against corrected plant design conditions. In addition, plant heat rate and output should also be tracked. HRSG and combined cycle plants are not equipped with sufficient instrumentation to
 properly monitor changing parameters&nbsp;and provide adequate feedback for owners or operators to make decisions. a project to adequately detail when a cleaning can be justified from a heat rate performance rather than a load reduction due to fouling or back pressure
 on the turbine is greatly needed.</p>

<p>A combined cycle unit is very similar in components to a conventional plant. The components are subject to the same extreme temperatures and pressures that a conventional unit has. Just like the BTF program, documentation of failure types and failure modes
 of valves, pumps etc is critical to accurate reliability analysis. There are areas related to balance of plant that can easily be overlooked&nbsp; that can affect reliability and affect both safety and profit of the units.</p>
<p>An initial literature and survey&nbsp;task is utilized to gain useful information. This could be coupled with previous EPRI research and reports to find similarities and highlight significant differences.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;guideline or document would then lead owners and operators as to what to look for and the&nbsp;industry problems around the balance of plant issues facing them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thermal mechanical fatigue damage is irreversible and its expenditure must be minimized from first firing of the CT/HRSG to conserve life expenditure to meet the longer term planned service life of the unit. Implementation of modifications to correct design
 features that cause high life expenditure rates is often either impractical or very costly in time and material costs once the HRSG has been fabricated.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;heavy stressed area of the HRSG is in the drain line and particularly the bellows protecting the drain lines. There bellows protect the high energy pipe drains and there have been several&nbsp;failures in the industry and several questions arise for repair
 and replacement. This project will set out to discover reasons for failures, timing and conditions of failures and establish a repair or replacement guideline.</p>

<p>In a typical heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), the inlet duct experiences a significant amount of turbulent, separated, unsteady flow. A common corrective action to mitigate the gradient is to install a flow distribution grid in the middle of the inlet
 duct to improve the flow quality. The fact that these distribution grids are repaired on a regular basis suggests that a solid understanding of the fluid mechanics—both steady and unsteady flow—could lead to better system performance and less facility downtime.
 To date, the electric power industry has lacked a comprehensive understanding of this process, and the designs for new installations usually do not address the issues associated with unsteady flow.&nbsp; In a step toward a better understanding of the problem, the
 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has supported research that uses a subscale model of a representative HRSG, described in detail in Section 2. An array of transducers was used to determine the magnitude and correlation of the unsteady pressure.</p>

<p>The changing thermodynamic characteristics of steam during startup conditions also produce component stresses and excess condensate that must be quickly drained. Less condensate is produced during fast startups, though more attemperation spray may be required
 to control steam pipe metal temperatures than when undergoing a routine startup. Low-load operations usually use more attemperation spray to control steam pipe metal temperatures than when undergoing a standard startup. Since low-load operations are generally
 at substantially lower pressures, this also offsets some of the more aggressive thermal characteristics of two-shift cycling under low-load operations. Many HRSG designs present condensate removal challenges during either type of start, which is a characteristic
 that varies greatly between HRSGs, even those built by the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>Under cycling conditions, other undesirable side effects are also possible, such as greater risk of water hammer in the reheat piping, thermal quenching of hot component surfaces due to spray valve degradation, and leakage or failure of the pressure boundary
 at tube-to-header welds, riser piping to drums, crossover (connecting) piping, and drain connections. Temperature control (heat tracing and in some cases portable heaters) may also be required to prevent tube and header failure during freezing conditions</p>
<p>These components can be severely affected especially when they are of a creep strength enhanced material such as P91. It is understood and researched&nbsp;among the standard&nbsp; carbon components how this affects reliability and life but this project will set out
 to discover issues with p91, discuss when and where they occurred and help owners and operators understand when to look, where to look and&nbsp;how to respond if affected. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) often have substantial internal and external piping to connect the various boiler sections and to carry feedwater to the HRSG and steam from the HRSG. The piping systems and components for HRSGs have many features in
 common with those found in traditional utility boilers, and therefore life assessment concepts and practices for conventional piping are to a large extent applicable to HRSG piping. However, HRSGs pose their own unique set of operational challenges, and the
 damage and failure mechanisms affecting HRSG piping therefore present some special aspects that should be considered when it comes to life assessment.</p>
<p>A project was completed in 2015 that summarized a few of the issues in the industry and&nbsp;some of the more common features of HRSG piping that have experienced failures, or that could theoretically be vulnerable. The report from that project&nbsp; provided a summary
 of pertinent&nbsp;damage mechanisms, followed by a series of topical summaries on specific issues and concerns. To keep the document accessible and manageable in size, the summaries&nbsp;were&nbsp;confined to the main points, with references listed for other sources that
 can provide more detailed information on each topic. The summaries are consistently organized, with subsections that overview the affected components, discuss the damage mechanisms involved, and provide specific suggestions for life assessment processes—analysis,
 inspection, on-line monitoring, and mitigation. Carefully selected photographs and diagrams support the discussions for each topic.</p>
<p>The approximately 20 years of operating experience in large HRSGs for power generation service has generated a large amount of knowledge and insight on vulnerabilities and failures related to both design and operation. Many of these have been documented
 extensively elsewhere, so this project&nbsp;aims to provide an overview of these mechanisms and also highlight some aspects (such as the potential for failure from large-bore branch connections) that have not been comprehensively documented in the past.</p>
<p>Appropriate training programs on operational considerations for cyclic duty can help operators become more aware of conditions in which thermal stresses on plant components might be particularly excessive, and be better able to take corrective actions to
 avert them. In addition , the use of effective analytical tools, diagnostic&nbsp;monitoring and control of instruments can provide valuable benefits and guidance to plant operators for reliable and efficient operation under cyclic or flexible duty. This project
 will set out to highlight existing tools, examine deficiencies needed for HRSG component inspection&nbsp;and begin a series of projects to provide guidance to owners and operators on HRSG component life assessment.</p>

<p>A heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) is much like other power generation equipment—run it at design conditions and chances are it will run with high availability and require only routine maintenance for many years. Mechanical problems within the HRSG are
 usually site- and vendor-specific, but experience has identified many common failure modes. The most common cause of HRSG failures (after malfunctioning equipment such as sprays or duct burner controls) is a change in operating profile, typically from base
 load to daily cycling, especially in markets with must-run wind generation. Although a change in operating routine doesn’t automatically translate into gross degradation in HRSG reliability, pressure parts are often susceptible to having less design margin
 and more vulnerability to consequential damage caused by other equipment.</p>
<p>Inlet duct distribution grids or duct liners typically take a considerable beating in cycling service. With the increased interest in flexible operation there continues to be several distribution (Perf) plate and duct liners failures in theHRSG fleet. This
 project will survey the industry to determine when and where the failures are occurring. It will&nbsp;highlight inspection techniques, establish repair practices, and provide a benchmarking tool to help owners assess the importance of the issues.</p>

 components&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most frequent occurring HRSG tube failure damage mechanisms include thermal, corrosion and creep fatigue. These are influenced by transiently high, thermally induced cyclic stresses caused by inadequate condensate attemperator control, and startup and
 shutdown rates which are too fast or do not allow the combustion turbine to match the capability of the HRSG tubing and headers. The objective of the overall work is to provide a set of tools and guidelines which operators can use to assess the thermal performance

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Air Quality Assessment of Ozone, Particulate Matter, Visibility, and Deposition Program develops highly accurate measurement and modeling tools to assess the complexity of how emissions from the electricity generation interact with other emissions,
 their chemical transformation, and environmental fate.</p>
<p>The development and application of rigorous air quality models, accurate ambient measurements, and the use of assessment tools based on credible science are needed to inform air quality management programs, such as those required by the U.S. Clean Air Act.
 Improved techniques are needed for estimating impact of emissions from various sources and regions (U.S. and international) and determining the impact of local, regional, and international pollution, including cross-state transport. These tools and techniques
 also can be used, for example, to inform the process of rulemakings related to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), develop state implementation plans (SIPs), and support activities such as the permitting of power plants worldwide. Over the
 past few years, as air quality standards have continued to be lowered, there is a need for advanced tools and refined scientific methods to address key challenges.</p>
<p>Given the already significant use of air quality models in regulatory applications and their continued expansion in setting air quality standards, it is imperative to improve or challenge the scientific premise supporting them and thus increase confidence
 in their use. This can be accomplished through a three-pronged approach of improving models, emissions inventories, and ambient measurements. It is clear that improving different air quality models (through better representation of chemistry and transport)
 is essential to informing decisions at different steps of the regulatory process. For the models to provide accurate results, the emissions data used as the input to the models should be developed with the best-available science and methods. Finally, only
 accurate air quality measurements can provide the “ground truthing” necessary to determine if the models are adequate for their proposed or intended uses, and more importantly assist in the basic scientific research that determines the mechanisms and modes
 of action that should be included during the model development process.</p>
<p>As the electricity system changes in the future into a multi-directional network of central and distributed generation, increased renewable and natural gas generation, microgrids, energy storage and electric vehicles, the resulting changes in emissions and
 their impacts must be assessed to determine their importance and relevance to future air quality. As these technology and electricity system changes are still ongoing, the range of potential associated environmental impacts (both positive and negative) have
 not yet been clearly defined or assessed. This program’s objective is to address the lack of data on key air quality issues by performing assessments needed to help lead the industry’s transition into the future.</p>

<p>The electric power industry needs an enhanced understanding of how emissions from power plants —in combination with emissions from other sources —influence the chemistry in the atmosphere and thus affect the formation, composition, and ensuing health effects
 of air pollutants. Assessing, developing and improving air quality models, improving emissions inventories, and ensuring accurate measurements of ambient air quality, visibility, and deposition are the focus of this program. Domestic and international air
 quality standards continue to be key issues for power plant owners and operators. Through this program, EPRI informs and advances the science supporting air quality models used for policy development, regulatory decision making, permitting, and implementation
 planning. Program research also informs power company environmental compliance activities, asset management, and long-term strategic planning which ultimately benefits the public through improved environmental conditions and/or cost benefits to help make electricity
 more affordable. Program results also inform the public and other stakeholders. With this research:</p>

<p>The permitting process for power plants and other large industrial sources relies heavily on the application of air dispersion models. In order to satisfy requirements for modeling secondary pollutants, photochemical grid models have also been proposed for
 permitting applications. Models are used to determine compliance with increasingly stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and other regulatory requirements such as New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of Significant Deterioration. EPA’s
 modeling guidance, the Guideline on Air Quality Models (also known as “Appendix W”), is designed to provide consistency and equity in the use of modeling within the U.S. air quality management process; the guidance was revised in 2016 to address secondary
 fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), in addition to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>).&nbsp; The revised Guideline provides guidance on how to address regional haze issues including applications
 for BART (Best Available Retrofit Technology) eligible sources.</p>
<p>Current models and methods used for regulatory air modeling and visibility analyses (e.g, as part of requirement under the Regional Haze Rule) can result in overly conservative estimates of a source’s potential contribution to ambient pollutant concentrations
 and visibility impairment because of the simple nature of these tools and their application. The nature of new ambient standards and the requirement to satisfy stricter emissions constraints during operation of power plants requires models and methods no longer
 based on simplistic assumptions.</p>

<p>Improving the detail and resolution of atmospheric measurements is essential for understanding the fate and impacts of emissions and transformation processes in the atmosphere, studying the human health and ecosystem effects of air pollution, and determination
 of the best ways to represent those processes in three-dimensional air quality models and other assessment tools. High-quality, highly time-resolved measurements also are required for evaluation of air quality models. In addition, such measurements provide
 the necessary input to source-receptor models, which are used in weight-of-evidence analyses to determine sources contributing to pollution at a receptor site.</p>
<p>However, most modeling studies rely only on ambient measurements from national monitoring networks, which for PM and its constituents are often taken only as a 24-hour average or cumulative measurements. These measurements can obscure or miss rapid changes
 in atmospheric composition or lead to poor interpretation of which sources are influencing air quality at a particular location. In addition, by necessity these networks typically use instruments designed first and foremost to be easy to operate, maintain
 and deploy, and some are becoming increasingly outdated. These methods may not provide the highest quality data in terms of chemical specificity, detection limits, or number of chemicals measured. Finally, static networks cannot cover all spatial and temporal
 locations of interest. Lack of high-resolution measurement data implies that air quality models are often not subject to rigorous evaluation, and use of those models can result in misinterpretation of model results, with subsequent impacts to air quality management
 strategies.</p>
<p>Additionally, a suite of novel approaches for measuring ambient air quality have been developed and increasingly deployed in the past several years.&nbsp; These include mobile and stationary monitoring with mid-tier complexity instruments and low-cost environmental
 microsensors. &nbsp;These are collectively referred to as Next Generation Monitoring technologies, and their use is being actively promoted by federal research and regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation,
 and others. These technologies have the potential to disruptively transform air quality monitoring, but they need to be rigorously tested against traditional monitoring approaches before being widely deployed.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is crucial to continue development and deployment of novel instrumentation to evaluate performance and test viability for use in either intensive or long-term continuous monitoring applications. Novel instruments may include approaches considered
 part of EPA’s Next Generation Monitoring initiative (such as mobile monitoring and microsensors), or stationary monitors targeting new chemical constituents of the atmosphere or using new modes of detection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, there is a continuing need to enhance three-dimensional air quality models in their representation of the atmospheric chemistry and transport of ozone, PM, regional haze, and atmospheric deposition.
 Traditional research to improve three-dimensional air quality models has focused on their application in the development of state implementation plans (in other words, control strategies) for compliance with air quality regulations. Over the past several years,
 the use of these models has also been extended to other parts of the air quality regulatory process. Most notably, as a result of EPA response to petitions by environmental groups, three-dimensional air quality models have been proposed for single-source modeling
 related to ozone and secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> applications.</p>
<p>In the coming years, EPA will develop new rules to address interstate pollution abatement based upon newer, more stringent levels of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and new methodologies to address interstate contributions to non-attainment
 areas and interferences with maintenance of attainment. Air quality models also are used for determining population exposures to air pollutants as part of epidemiological studies. Without testing the appropriateness of applying such models to these health
 studies, their conclusions remain in question.</p>
<p>Although EPRI and other researchers have made significant improvements in the representation of organic particulate matter (PM) in current air quality models, there is a need to further improve models in this area. Enhanced models developed in this project
 will provide the best available tools to stakeholders for developing implementation plans to attain increasingly stringent ozone and PM standards and meet regional haze goals. For example, these models can be used to assess different control technology and
 control strategy options. The models will also inform the development of future cross-state air pollution abatement (transport) rules.</p>

<p>In the past several years, there has been increasing focus by the regulatory and scientific communities on atmospheric deposition as it relates to acid and nutrient loading in ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition of acids and nutrients can influence the biogeochemistry
 of ecosystems. Deposition of several atmospheric pollutants can lead to acidification, which has been associated with a decline in forest tree species and loss of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. Nutrient deposition has been associated with disruption in
 the biodiversity of ecosystems and eutrophication of water bodies, which can contribute to toxic algal blooms and fish hypoxia. EPA considered proposing a new Secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for oxides of nitrogen and sulfur (NOx and
 SOx) based on an aquatic acidification standard that is related to the deposition of these compounds. As EPA renews its efforts to evaluate a Secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx, it will continue to explore how other ecological impacts (terrestrial acidification
 and aquatic/terrestrial nutrient enrichment) also may be incorporated into the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Assessing the impacts of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, as well as reduced nitrogen species such as ammonia gas and associated ammonium particles, from different sources to potentially sensitive ecosystems and waterways continue
 to be important research directions to inform the development of Secondary NAAQS.</p>

<p>As the electricity system changes in the future &nbsp;into a multi-directional network of central and distributed generation, increased renewable and natural gas generation, microgrids, energy storage and electric vehicles, the resulting changes in emissions
 and their impact must be reviewed and assessed to determine their importance and relevance to future air quality. These changes include (1) expanded use of small flexible fossil generation units for the direct production of electricity or to provide ancillary
 services that support the grid, (2) increasing amounts of consumer-facing electronics, (3) implementation of novel operational strategies for power plants and emissions control technologies. As these technology and electricity system changes are still ongoing,
 the range of potential associated environmental impacts (both positive and negative) have not yet been clearly defined or assessed. This project addresses the lack of data on key air quality issues by performing assessments needed to help lead the industry’s
 transition into the future.</p>
<p>Traditional fossil fuel-fired central site generation facilities are also subjected to new, and sometimes extensive, changes of a variety of non-baseload operational conditions. This includes increased frequency of cycling, with a number of different types
 of ramping, turn down, and fluctuating patterns.&nbsp; The drivers of flexible operations are numerous, and include increased amounts of intermittent generation entering the grid, uncertain fuel prices load growth and energy policy, active customer behavior (e.g.,
 renewable and electric transportation installation), renewable portfolio standards, and more stringent environmental regulations. Despite this need for increased flexibility, unit operations need to comply with environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Other technologies currently present on the grid, but expected to have increased future deployment, are distributed energy resources. In addition to providing for site-specific electricity needs, distributed fossil generation may also increase as a way to
 balance out intermittent renewable generation at various scales, as well as to provide ancillary services to grid stability. Currently the dominant source of distributed fossil generation both on the grid and behind-the-meter are diesel-fired reciprocating
 engines, as well as natural gas-fired combustion and aeroderivative turbines.&nbsp; Future deployments will predominantly include natural gas-fired engines and turbines. The emission rates from some of these unit types are well known, while others have more limited
 data available from real-world operational settings. There are few comprehensive assessments of subsequent impacts to air quality as a result of operation of these units; it is important to understand the potential for both local and regional benefits and
 impacts.</p>

<p>EPA’s Regional Haze Rule (RHR) is a long-term regulation that requires visibility in Class I areas to return to natural levels by 2064. In attributing haze to emissions from a specific source, an important step is calculating the relationship between fine
 particle composition and haze by estimating how much light is scattered or absorbed by sulfate, nitrate, organic materials, black carbon, and other PM components.</p>
<p>EPRI research developed a new algorithm, which was accepted by EPA, for calculating haze indices and attributing haze levels to specific components. Many outstanding issues still remain to understand the relationship between particle composition and haze,
 and further research is needed. EPRI designed studies to address these issues by collection of new particle and visibility data at Class I areas and by focused laboratory experiments. Further analysis of those data has demonstrated issues related with relationships
 between the fine particle composition and haze.</p>
<p>Another key challenge with the RHR is how to define or determine the levels of natural visibility that each Class I area must achieve by 2064. EPA’s definition of this endpoint does not include transboundary anthropogenic pollutants, as well as new science
 pertinent to understanding naturally occurring levels of particles contributing to haze. Although EPRI research shows that states need to recognize the importance of transboundary pollution when developing plans for meeting regional haze progress goals, significant
 uncertainty remains in estimating the transboundary contribution of organic aerosol concentrations.</p>
<p>Urban visibility has become an important research and regulatory issue, as EPA has increased efforts to develop secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> standards to protect visibility in urban areas. Some issues related to urban visibility are similar to the regional
 haze issues (e.g., relationship between fine particle and composition and visibility degradation), but separate studies focusing on urban areas are necessary to address knowledge gaps specific to urban visibility. One of these items is the adequacy, or lack
 thereof, of visibility preference studies that have been used by EPA in developing levels of visibility metrics in its first analysis of potential secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> standards based on protecting visibility. There is a need to conduct more-robust studies
 that can be applied at a national scale, rather than the current studies that consider only the preferences of people in the specific regions where the studies were conducted. Other issues include the frequently higher spatial heterogeneity and increased change
 of interferences that may exist in urban areas as a result of the more numerous types of emissions sources present there.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Assessment of Air Quality Impacts on Human Health program addresses key scientific uncertainties regarding the health effects of criteria air pollutants, with the objective of informing industry stakeholders, regulators, and the public - in the United
 States as well as internationally -&nbsp;to ensure the development of protective public health policies and standards based upon the latest scientific data and analyses.</p>
<p>Protecting public health and the environment is the primary goal of environmental regulation. However, how to achieve that goal is an ongoing dialogue among U.S. and international regulators, administrators, scientists, and other stakeholders. For example,
 in the US the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set limits for ambient concentrations of six&nbsp;pollutants (carbon monoxide [CO], lead, nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>], particulate matter [PM], ozone [O<sub>3</sub>], and sulfur
 dioxide [SO<sub>2</sub>]) considered harmful to public health. Recognizing that knowledge about health impacts of air pollutants evolves as scientific studies produce new results, air quality standards require periodic review of the science upon which the
 standards are based. Conducting research that informs this review process, as well as other regulatory actions and the health impacts of air pollution at the local, international and national level, is the focus of EPRI's Air Quality Health program.</p>
<p>The program’s health effects information, developed from epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure assessment studies, as well as applied risk assessment analyses, addresses key scientific uncertainties related to health effects of PM, ozone, and other air
 pollutants. The focus of current research is on closing research gaps related to several key scientific issues, including investigation of the long-term effects of air pollution; the existence of a minimum threshold concentration before health effects from
 various criteria pollutants start to occur; further study of the health effects of ozone; the extent of life shortening due to air pollution; and the methods employed for calculating benefits of air pollution regulations. In addition, the program’s forward
 thinking, proactive, and strategic nature ensures that the research also includes evaluation of the potential health impacts of new generation and non-generation technologies that may be part of the power system of the future.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Air Quality Health program focuses on key issues relevant to the U.S. and international power industry. Risk assessments generate results to inform different aspects of NAAQS establishment for criteria pollutants in the U.S. Work on benefits of air
 pollution regulations is critical in developing realistic estimates for Regulatory Impact Analyses, for example, that reflect key scientific uncertainties. Continuing research on the extent of life shortening caused by air pollution is of high value in determining
 whether premature mortality is occurring in young, otherwise healthy people, or in elderly people in declining health. This is an important distinction from a policy perspective and may have a considerable impact on overall benefits ascribed to reductions
 in air pollution. The determination of whether a threshold exists – that is, whether there is a concentration below which health effects may not occur – is also a critical scientific question that to date has not been adequately evaluated.</p>
<p>A particular focus of EPRI’s Air Quality Health program over the past several years has been on ozone health effects. An instrumental chamber study of asthmatic humans, designed to better understand the threshold for ozone in a sensitive subpopulation, will
 be completed in 2017; the results of this study are expected to inform the next review of the ozone NAAQS. Additional epidemiological analyses of EPRI’s ARIES and Medicare datasets planned for 2017 will also inform this regulatory activity. This research is
 also important for generating health information relevant to international settings.</p>
<p>EPRI is also continuing important work on the health effects of PM components, as this research has the potential to catalyze a paradigm shift informing how PM is regulated. The current mass-based approach regulates total PM concentration; however, PM is
 composed of hundreds, if not thousands, of individual components, and there is a growing scientific consensus that not all of these components are equally toxic. This research addresses key scientific uncertainties to determine which components of air pollution
 are associated with negative health impacts (and which are not) and generates information to support health risk estimates of air pollution components. The value of the research is in its ability to more accurately identify the specific causative agents, and
 thus the sources of those agents, affecting human health and the environment.</p>
<p>With this research program:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Air pollution health research considers the full spectrum of pollutants necessary to ensure that public health is adequately protected; further, EPRI is the only research and development organization that addresses the unique power industry air pollution
 issues relevant to coal and natural gas-fired power plants&nbsp; and how they fit into the larger picture of emissions from other sources</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Peer-reviewed publications reporting research results provide input into regulatory standard-setting processes and inform the broader scientific and stakeholder community.
</li></ul>
<p>The research conducted in this program benefits local, regional, national, and international stakeholders, including the public, by providing information to help develop air quality regulations that are based on sound science.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI takes the unique and multidisciplinary approach of combining epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure assessment studies, as well as applied risk assessment analyses, organized into an issue-based framework focusing on PM, ozone, risk and benefits assessment,
 and the power system of the future. For example, EPRI air quality health research is critical to informing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) statute-required review of air pollution standards and its research will be considered in the next
 revision to the NAAQS for PM expected in 2021. EPRI also provides informative briefings to state and federal policymakers on its research results. Work is also focused on areas of high relevance to international settings. The issue areas use the following
 study designs/disciplines to achieve the required results:</p>
<p>Air pollution epidemiology studies examine human populations to determine the statistical links between pollutant exposures and adverse health effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure assessment studies characterize the components and sources of air pollution to which people are exposed.
</li><li>Toxicology studies (laboratory studies conducted in cell systems, animals, or humans) evaluate health impacts of pollutants under controlled conditions.
</li><li>Risk assessment and other applied analyses focus on specific inputs or issues related to criteria pollutant risk assessment.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>All research results are published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature to ensure they can be considered in standard-setting activities as well as inform the scientific community. Importantly, the program’s communication activities also ensure that
 results are disseminated in formats suitable for stakeholders and public audiences. The scientific results from this program are highly applicable to international audiences.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Air Quality Health program focuses on developing key scientific information related to the health effects of criteria air pollutants. Major accomplishments include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Program staff published two articles in the peer-reviewed literature that reviewed all available short-term and long-term studies related to PM components and health; the short-term article concluded that carbon-containing constituents warrant more attention,
 while the long-term article pointed to the scarcity of informative studies. Program staff also published a comprehensive review paper covering the state of the science of the health effects of organic PM.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ongoing research related to benefits estimation tools indicates that when alternative assumptions regarding benefits inputs are made, estimated benefits from air pollution regulations can span a wide range that includes zero. Integrated uncertainty analyses
 incorporating probabilities further highlight the sensitivity of benefits estimates to input variables.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Research on the extent of life shortening finds that death in affected individuals is hastened by only several days, not months or years.
</li><li>Short-term epidemiological studies (ARIES) point to the importance of carbon-containing PM in adverse health effects, while long-term studies (Medicare cohort) suggest that confounding (a type of bias) of the longer-term studies may be present.
</li><li>EPRI toxicology studies have shown that adverse cardiovascular effects were primarily associated with trace metals from smelting, incineration, and metal processing sources, and that only mild toxicological effects were observed in rats exposed to coal
 combustion emissions. </li><li>EPRI’s epidemiological research highlights the importance of multi-pollutant models – those that consider many pollutants simultaneously – as those are a more realistic reflection of true human exposure and often show attenuated risks compared with single-pollutant
 models. </li></ul>

<p>PM benefits and risk assessment plays a key role in Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) for any EPA regulation that either targets PM directly or that includes co-benefits of PM reductions (for example, EGU [Electric Generating Unit] Mercury and Air Toxics
 Standards [MATS]). Both costs (control costs to meet a particular regulation) and benefits (monetization of health benefits purported to occur as a result of mitigation of air pollution) are considered as part of RIAs. Generation of primary health data from
 observational studies of human populations is critical for developing concentration-response functions that are used in benefit calculations. Once the data are generated from these long-term studies, many activities can be conducted using these and other data
 in the short term that can inform PM risk assessment. This project consists of a portfolio of research that is intended to address key issues related to risk assessment inputs or methodologies, or to the communication of risk to the public.</p>

<p>Currently, the energy system is undergoing rapid change in efforts to be responsive to the needs for flexibility, resiliency and reliability in the future. This future energy system will consist of a multi-directional grid connecting central and distributed
 generation, increased renewable and natural gas generation, microgrids, energy storage and new technologies such as electric vehicles. The potential impacts of this system on public health have not been fully articulated or quantified as yet. It is critical
 that the positive and negative impacts of emerging energy technologies and their interconnections be investigated at early stages in advance of their widespread deployment in order to ensure proactive solutions, should issues be identified.</p>

<p>Air pollution is a complex mixture composed of multiple particle- and gas-phase materials. Two of the criteria gases regulated by EPA as part of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) process under the Clean Air Act are sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)
 and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). The roles played by SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in health effects attributed to air pollution need clarification to most effectively protect public health, particularly in light of recently proposed, or enacted,
 changes to the NAAQS for these gases, both of which are emitted directly from fossil fuel combustion. It is important to understand their roles in potential health effects so that risk management strategies can be designed to protect public health at the least
 cost.</p>

<p>Ozone is regulated by the US EPA as a criteria pollutant under the Clean Air Act. Recently, the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) was lowered to 70 ppb from the previous 75 ppb, continuing a trend of ratcheting down of the standard. This
 makes the issue of thresholds – that is, a level of ozone below which there may be no adverse effects – a critical issue for informing the development of any future ozone standards. Ozone is associated with power plant emissions due to the fact that it forms
 in part from NOx, which is directly emitted from fossil fuel combustion</p>

<p>The NAAQS for particulate matter (PM) is reviewed on a five-year cycle. The current standard is often exceeded in many parts of the country, and secondary particles associated with power industry emissions (sulfate and nitrate) are a major component of ambient
 PM. There are many scientific uncertainties regarding the health effects of PM, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The PM sources and components most strongly associated with adverse health impacts;</p>
</li><li>
<p>The potential for bias in long-term study risk estimates that are currently used by EPA;</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The extent of life shortening caused by exposure to PM; and </li><li>The potential existence of a no-effect threshold below which no adverse health effects may be expected.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>High-quality, scientifically robust, and focused epidemiological and toxicological studies are needed to inform regulators and other stakeholders about these issues.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Energy storage and distributed generation technologies are attracting increasing interest from utilities and regulators as localized flexible grid assets. Storage can act as a buffer between electricity supply and demand, increasing the flexibility of the
 grid and allowing greater accommodation of variable renewable resources. Distributed generation (DG) entails the production of power at or near load centers, thereby augmenting or substituting electricity infrastructure with DG fuel infrastructure, where appropriate.
 Both storage and DG may provide temporary solutions for regional and local capacity shortages, and may provide relief to localized transmission and distribution congestion.</p>
<p>Technology advances, as well as investment in production capacity, have resulted in significant cost reductions of energy storage and distributed generation. However, the economic use of these technologies still generally requires the user to take full advantage
 of multiple potential benefit streams. The various applications that contribute to the value of distributed resources have different requirements, and the ways in which these requirements are coincident or competitive are still being explored. Technologies
 such as fuel cells, microturbines and small reciprocating generators are still relatively expensive in terms of installed capital cost, but low fuel costs and opportunities offered by the application of combined-heat-and-power (CHP) architectures may make
 them increasingly cost-effective options in the future.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the factors that may make storage and distributed generation technologies technically and economically viable in the future, whether the devices are owned and operated by utilities, by customers, or by third-parties. While storage
 and distributed generation options are rapidly maturing and are beginning to become practical in grid applications, there are still significant challenges to overcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the performance characteristics, cost, expected service lifetime, and relative maturity of various storage and distributed generation technologies in grid applications
</li><li>Identifying the additional hardware, software, and user interfaces required to implement distributed resources on the grid
</li><li>Defining the technical requirements for various applications of energy storage
</li><li>Understanding the possible impact on transmission and distribution system planning, as well as construction and operations
</li><li>Assessing the various uses of storage and distributed generation, including performance requirements, cost break-even points, and valuation
</li><li>Understanding the effects of policy and regulation on the adoption and cost-effectiveness of storage and distributed generation applications
</li><li>Understanding the environmental impact of storage and distributed generation </li></ul>
<p>Research projects that address these challenges can help move practical storage and distributed generation technologies forward and enhance the value of these technologies to society.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI research focuses on facilitating the availability, use, and integration of grid-ready energy storage and distributed generation options for utility applications, as well as informing utilities, regulators, government agencies, and the general public
 on technical and economic issues, opportunities, and challenges related to the use of utility-scale energy storage and distributed generation.</p>
<p>The EPRI collaborative research environment enables engagement with utilities, technology developers, and other stakeholders to test and evaluate new technologies and products, define functional requirements for energy storage systems, develop tools and
 methodologies to analyze the effects of storage on the power delivery network and optimize their use, and create approaches that assess the business cases for storage in various applications and regions.</p>
<p>Through this program, utilities, government bodies, storage developers and vendors, electricity end users, and other stakeholders will be better informed about the opportunities and challenges facing electric energy storage and distributed generation technologies
 and products deployed on the grid.</p>
<p>This program conducts research to advance energy storage and distributed generation technologies as grid-integrated resources that can enhance the flexibility of the electricity system to manage peak demands and accommodate the intermittency of renewable
 resources, thereby improving the reliability and environmental impact of electric service to benefit society.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This EPRI research will be shared with program members in a number of formats, and is expected to include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic intelligence and specific technology assessments of energy storage and related distributed energy resource (DER) options
</li><li>Industry white papers to inform stakeholders on the maturity of various energy storage and DER technologies and the potential of grid-related applications
</li><li>Functional requirement documents and technical specifications for grid-connected distributed storage and generation systems that can increase the flexibility of distribution grids as well as the bulk power system
</li><li>Deep dives into the cost and performance of energy storage and distributed generation technology options
</li><li>Up-to-date case summaries of on-going energy storage demonstrations </li><li>Test reports providing data on the operating envelope, performance, and durability of emerging energy storage systems
</li><li>Case studies to define storage operational requirements, suitable locations, and scale, as well as duration requirements of storage solutions for maximizing the expected benefits
</li><li>Industry forums, such as the Energy Storage Integration Council (ESIC), which bring together utilities, vendors, integrators, regulators, and other stakeholders to discuss technical issues related to energy storage specification, deployment, and operation
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Energy Storage and Distributed Generation program has delivered valuable information over the years that have helped its members and the industry in numerous ways. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPRI created the <em>Energy Storage Cost Benchmarking Database </em>1.0 (EPRI 1024279) in 2012, and is updating it in 2016. This interactive cost tool builds on work done in previous years, particularly the
<em>Energy Storage Technology and Application Cost and Performance Database</em> (EPRI 1021932) with updated data on the cost, performance, and capabilities of energy storage systems for various applications in an Excel-based software tool. The goal of the
 database is to develop consistent installed costs, and operations and maintenance costs, for a set of selected energy storage systems providing an identified set of services.
</li><li>In 2016, EPRI released an <em>Energy Storage Cost Template and Tool</em> to assist in the development of cost estimate for field installations of energy storage. &nbsp;The tool, reviewed and released publicly through ESIC, is expected to be used by utilities
 and vendors to help standardize cost approaches for energy storage systems. </li><li>In 2015, EPRI released the <em>Integration Guidelines for Energy Storage</em>, a project management handbook for distribution connected energy storage developed and reviewed through the ESIC.&nbsp;
</li><li>EPRI released the <em>Energy Storage Valuation Tool </em>(ESVT) 4.0 in 2014. &nbsp;A successor tool StorageVET, is scheduled for release in 2016. StorageVET is a software program that can help utilities and regulators understand when and where grid-connected
 energy storage systems can be justified in terms of benefit and cost. This tool is continuously refined and updated. &nbsp;In early 2013, EPRI used inputs from the California Public Utility Commission Stakeholder Group for the Energy Storage Order Instituting Rulemaking
 process to inform the group's discussion on targets for energy storage adoption in California. Since that time, EPRI has worked with more than a dozen utilities to use and assess the analysis methodology in their service territories.
</li><li>EPRI worked with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, (NRECA), Sandia National Laboratory, and several other stakeholders including a number of utilities, to develop the DOE-EPRI Energy Storage Handbook.
 Available free to the public from Sandia National Laboratory (SAND2013-5131), this handbook is a comprehensive introduction to designing, procuring, installing, and operating utility-scale energy storage systems, and serves as a resource to utilities, vendors,
 and other stakeholders in the utility energy storage area. </li><li>In 2013, EPRI established the <em>Energy Storage Integration Council </em>(ESIC), a technical forum in which electric utilities guide a discussion with energy storage vendors, technology researchers, government organizations, and other stakeholders to develop
 reliable, safe, and cost-effective energy storage options for the utility industry. In less than one year, the organization has grown to represent more than a hundred stakeholders in the energy storage area, addressing critical technical issues to support
 the imminent deployment of energy storage systems in several jurisdictions around the world.

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>In 2017, this research program expects to accomplish these objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue refinement of StorageVET to allow faster and more accurate estimates of the value of grid-connected energy storage systems in various scenarios, based on case studies and applications in real-world utility cases.
</li><li>Extend the methodology for distribution-level analysis of grid impacts of energy storage using OpenDSS or similar tools, and develop case studies that can inform the refinement of reference specifications, enhance the accuracy of value analysis tools, and
 inform the creation of appropriate algorithms for the control of energy storage.
</li><li>Extend the methodology for bulk system-level analysis for the use of energy storage on the grid, using Plexos® or similar tools, and to develop case studies that can similarly inform the specification, analysis, and operational algorithms needed for the
 effective use of energy storage on the grid. </li><li>Continue conducting the Energy Storage Integration Council, and expand ties with DOE, the vendor community, and industry groups such as the Electricity Storage Association (ESA), the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the International
 Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). </li></ul>

<p>Current and emerging energy storage technologies and products could bring new opportunities for improved control and reliability of utility operations, reduced cost for new infrastructure and enhanced integration of renewable generation. However, utilities
 and other stakeholders require the right tools and guidelines to understand where energy storage makes sense, and how to apply it when it does.&nbsp; Such information includes technical characteristics, technology performance and cost information, and guidelines
 for safe and reliable specification and integration of energy storage options.</p>
<p>This project set provides a collection of foundational tools, analysis results, and industry guidelines for identifying, assessing, and integrating energy storage across a range of use cases. &nbsp;This information is crucial for strategic planning, deployment,
 and operation of energy storage. As part of this project EPRI intends to produce annual in-depth technology assessments, track and assess cost and performance of energy storage products and projects across a range of uses, and develop tools, methods, and analyses
 of the benefits of energy storage relative to the costs. &nbsp;EPRI also intends to produce individual assessments of energy storage technologies and to conduct the Energy Storage Integration Council, a forum bringing together utilities, vendors, government, and
 other research organizations&nbsp;for technical collaboration to advance a comprehensive set of energy storage integration guidelines across the lifecycle of energy storage projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this project, EPRI seeks to address the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the&nbsp;value of energy storage systems to generation, transmission, and distribution utility functions, as well as to end use customers, based on advanced analytical tools&nbsp;that model production cost, transmission power flow, distribution systems, and
 customer impacts? </li><li>What is the cost of energy storage today, and what is the impact of size, location, technology, and applications?
</li><li>What is the detailed information on the technical performance and economics of specific energy storage technologies of interest?
</li><li>What are the key technical issues and the current best practices and guidelines for the integration of energy storage projects?

<p>This project develops foundational analysis tools, methodologies, and summary analyses that provide strategic information on the value of energy storage systems relative to their costs.&nbsp; The primary investigation of this project is to determine how to determine
 the uses, locations, and technology characteristics of energy storage systems that make economic sense for deployment.&nbsp; Techno-economic analyses are approached at different levels of detail, which include tradeoffs of cost, complexity, and accuracy.&nbsp; This
 project will seek to develop methods that are appropriate for all levels of detail, including regional screening, site-specific benefit-cost analysis, and analysis that informs product and project design optimization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Distributed energy storage technologies such as batteries have progressed immensely in the last decade, improving substantially in performance while dropping in price, as a result of sustained investment driven by the need for better storage technologies
 for mobile electronics and electric vehicles. Storage developers and integrators are now turning their attention toward developing complete grid storage products that incorporate storage technologies with power electronics, thermal management, and control
 systems. These products are still relatively immature, but are making rapid strides toward deployment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, utilities are beginning to address issues related to integrating storage to the grid, including interconnection, protection, communication, grid effects, and operational algorithms. Collaborative research bringing together efforts from utilities,
 storage vendors, integrators, and other stakeholders, can accelerate this process towards cost-effective energy storage products that are ready for deployment and operation as grid assets in substations, along the feeder, and beyond the meter.</p>
<p>To implement these new products, utilities need empirical information on costs, performance, operational characteristics, reliability, risks, and durability. Research is required to better understand grid integration solutions and tools, including energy
 storage system capabilities such as performance, efficiency, and cycling capability.</p>
<p>This project set focuses on applied research to facilitate the incorporation of energy storage technologies into complete, grid-ready storage systems that can be easily deployed on the grid, as well as methods to support the proper integration of such systems
 into the bulk grid. Research includes testing storage system capabilities and advancing grid-integration tools via case studies and tool development. Research also aims to understand the performance and technical readiness of energy storage technologies to
 provide desirable utility modes of operation under varying conditions. In addition, research examines the effects of storage on the grid in terms of stability, control, reliability, and impacts on transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) system planning, construction,
 and operation to ensure that the physical connection of storage solutions is effective.</p>

<p>Traditional distribution planning techniques are well established in the power systems, yet the majority of energy storage systems are deployed in the field without these analyses. The technical studies done so far typically do not quantify the relative
 benefits of energy storage systems’ size and deployment locations. The storage systems on the distribution system have been deployed ad hoc depending on what manufacturers have offered in terms of rating (MW, MWh), controls, and performance. The fundamental
 issue with any of the current approaches used for energy storage assessment is that these valuation analyses are performed on an ad hoc basis. These analyses are typically performed without taking into consideration the technical attributes and operational
 capabilities of a distribution feeder to which it will connect. For a specific operational use of energy storage, the effects of combining primary grid services benefits with multiple secondary benefits are therefore difficult to evaluate quantitatively.</p>
<p>The creation of a formal process is therefore required to understand the potential grid impacts and benefit of various PV deployments scenarios and opportunities of energy storage (utility-connected as well as customer sited) along the distribution system.
 To determine whether the energy storage system will fit into the utility’s grid system, this assessment will develop case study and data analytics necessary to perform the technical and cost/benefit analysis of realizing the potential solution opportunities
 of energy storage.</p>
<p>The project will expand EPRI’s efforts&nbsp;to model the effects of grid-integrated storage&nbsp;in terms of voltage impact, control and communications, operational requirements, and identification of suitable locations and scale for connecting storage.</p>
<p>Research may include the development of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools and models for distribution-level energy storage systems, including grid-effects models and control modeling
</li><li>Deployment guidelines highlighting procedures for siting, permitting, and site preparation at storage installation sites
</li><li>Interconnection and integration guidelines for energy storage systems connected to the distribution system
</li><li>Charge/discharge profiles, control&nbsp;schema, and communications protocols for distribution energy storage systems
</li><li>Requirements and considerations in&nbsp;contracting for energy storage systems as a service
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>The scope will depend on available funding as well as priorities expressed by members.</p>
<p>What are the effects of energy storage systems on the distribution system, including voltage impact and operational requirements? Can modeling help site and scale energy storage systems for grid interconnection?</p>

<p>Cost-effective and reliable bulk energy storage can benefit the electric power delivery network by balancing supply and demand and optimizing bulk power resources, including nuclear, fossil, and renewable resources. &nbsp;Bulk energy storage can also enhance
 transmission system effectiveness by allowing system operators to move energy at off-peak times when transmission lines are less fully loaded. &nbsp;As&nbsp;state renewable portfolio standards (RPS) continue to increase, encouraging a high penetration rate of variable
 renewable resources, bulk power storage provides an important option to help utilities manage the variability of renewable resources.</p>

<p>Bulk energy storage systems have the potential to enhance grid flexibility, reliability and durability by providing many market-based services and facilitating better utilization of existing grid assets. Bulk storage can also enhance wind farm economics
 and facilitate variable generation integration. As a result, a wide variety of bulk storage technologies are emerging. Some of these technologies are at, or near, pilot-scale demonstration on the grid, while others are at earlier technology readiness levels.
 This project examines the questions of the performance, cost, functional capabilities and development timeline of select bulk storage technologies.</p>

<p>The falling cost of energy storage technologies, along with government incentives and changes in regulations in some jurisdictions, has increased the interest in the placement of energy storage&nbsp;systems at customer sites.&nbsp; Customer-sited storage has many
 potential benefits, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Backup power to reduce the duration of power interruptions </li><li>Reduced demand charges </li><li>Shifting of locally-produced solar energy to match local demand </li><li>Support of electric vehicle charging </li><li>The possibility of conducting arbitrage if time-of-use rates are available.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>Customer-sited storage can be even more attractive when tied with distributed energy resources. &nbsp;EPRI is investigating how storage can be best integrated with technologies such as solar PV, solar forecasting, fuel cells, load management, and energy efficiency
 to improve reliability and value to the end consumer while also increasing the flexibility and reliability of the grid.</p>
<p>Natural gas distributed generation can also have a strong value proposition for customers, particularly when combined with waste heat recovery. This high-efficiency approach particularly makes sense where the prices of both natural gas and electricity are
 high (such as parts of Europe and Asia).&nbsp; Such applications are also worth study to understand the effect on other uses of distributed generation, such as providing resiliency. Regulatory and legislative actions are leading to increased adoption, and utilities
 would be wise to take these resources into account in their overall planning process, and possibly take advantage of them through an Integrated Grid approach.</p>
<p>As these products become increasingly viable, it is important that utilities, regulators, customers, and other stakeholders acquire sound empirical information on performance, costs, operational characteristics, reliability, risks, and durability of customer-sited
 products. Research is required to better understand grid integration solutions and tools, including energy storage system capabilities such as performance, efficiency, and cycling capability.</p>
<p>This project set focuses on applied research to understand the issues related to customer-sited energy storage and distributed generation, both grid-connected and off-grid. While utilities may not be directly involved with off-grid systems, it is important
 to understand the performance capabilities and limitations of such systems, as well as their costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customer-sited energy storage systems are rapidly achieving viability and deployment in places across the world.&nbsp; Several Japanese companies, including Panasonic and Hitachi, have released residential and commercial electric energy storage systems in Japan
 to address capacity issues in the wake of the Fukushima incident.&nbsp; Likewise, German companies such as Sonnenschein have produced high-quality integrated residential storage products as a response to policy incentives favoring self-consumption.&nbsp; More recently,
 companies such as Sunverge and Tesla have released prominent products into the North American market.&nbsp; In addition, there are also a number of thermal storage systems on the market, including hot water heaters and ice storage systems, which can be used as
 effectively as electrical energy storage in many contexts.</p>
<p>It is important for utilities, regulators, customers, and other stakeholders to understand how well these products work, how much they cost, and what is entailed in their operation.</p>

<p>The existence and deployment of customer-sited energy storage leads to the question of where such systems can be most useful to customers.&nbsp; While the backup benefits of energy storage are well-understood, other applications, such as demand peak reduction,
 require more sophisticated technical and economic analysis.&nbsp; It is also worth considering whether customer-sited storage might be used with solar to operate off-grid, and how other technologies such as load control can be used to enhance the value of storage.</p>

<p>Combined heat and power (CHP) is a unique opportunity to produce power and heat at high efficiency on the customer side of the meter, using distributed&nbsp; generation devices.&nbsp; CHP is typically conducted with a high-temperature energy conversion device such
 as a turbine or a fuel cell, set up in a system designed to collect waste heat from the energy conversion process.&nbsp; This research will explore the options and considerations related to the deployment of customer-side combined heat and power (CHP) installations.</p>

<p>Microgrids are a potential strategy to improve power system resiliency while making good use of distributed renewable generation. The objective for each end-user, or community, is to build on the reliability of the existing grid connection in a compatible
 and interactive way. Detailed assessments are needed to evaluate objective and feasibility as a resiliency improvement, including validation of various arrangements, configurations, interconnection issues, communication methods, and control systems. Site-specific
 energy economics and environmental constraints are also critical aspects of feasibility. &nbsp;The purpose of this project is to examine where microgrids are compatible, complementary, and appropriately interactive with the existing grid.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The relationship between international and domestic climate policies and ultimately how domestic regulations are implemented can yield dramatically different outcomes in total cost and who pays. In particular, the form of domestic policies will influence
 the role of the power sector in achieving economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets. In the U.S., where federal climate policy is being implemented sector-by-sector, policy incentives discourage electrification – effectively foregoing one of the
 most promising approaches to a lower-carbon future.</p>
<p>As individual nations and the global community seek realistic, achievable, and responsible paths forward, good information and careful framing of key questions are critical. The global power industry plays a key role.&nbsp;In the United States, climate policies
 are being implemented in a variety of ways that require an improved understanding of the fundamentals of the issue. Assessments of the potential impacts from climate change (such as the social cost of carbon) are being used as key elements of U.S. federal,
 state and local regulations. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Conference of the Parties (COP21) concluded with an agreement that for the first time included commitments to limit GHG emissions from almost
 all of the world’s countries. The unique scientific, economic, and technological concerns of the power industry are critical to the policy debate, and research is essential to informing stakeholder discussions over the fundamental form and the details of these
 policy actions. Building the understanding and institutional capacity to implement efficient policies to reduce GHG emissions will take years, but the payoff will be considerable.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’S) Energy and Climate Policy Analysis program provides public- and private-sector decision makers with analyses and information on the potential costs and benefits of domestic and international policy proposals
 and regulations. The program’s modeling and analyses provide crucial information needed to make economically and environmentally sound climate and energy policy decisions, and also inform power companies of the possible near-, mid-, and long-term implications
 of different policy approaches, helping them to make better decisions. Program research focuses on estimating the economic costs of climate policy proposals against the backdrop of other energy, environmental, and economic policies; identifying cost-effective
 strategies and policy principles for reducing these costs, including evaluating adaptation and mitigation strategies for managing climate change risk; and comparing potential costs with the potential avoided risks of lower GHG concentrations. The research
 also examines the value of technological advances in limiting policy costs, and explores emission offsets as a large-scale, low-cost, and environmentally effective compliance strategy. Investing in technology and policy design research today is essential to
 having these emission reduction options available when needed in the future.</p>
<p>The research in this program provides essential inputs to, and is closely tied to, the complementary research conducted in two other program under Energy and Environmental Analysis: Analysis of Environmental Policy Design, Implementation and Company Strategy
 and Technology Assessment, Market Analysis and Integrated Portfolio Planning.&nbsp; It also provide essential inputs into EPRI’s Integrated Energy Network effort.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Well-informed policy choices can help society achieve environmental goals efficiently and effectively, avoiding problematic designs and saving trillions of dollars. This program has a strong track record of identifying critical issues, performing world-class
 research, and putting insights into the hands of companies, domestic and international decision makers, and the public dialogue at the right time. The program’s internationally recognized experts are effectively able to bridge the often-broad gap between the
 technical and policy communities. In particular, this program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzes the potential cost and benefit implications of domestic and international climate policy proposals, supplying policymakers and power industry executives with crucial, analytically rigorous information for economically and environmentally sound
 policy decisions; </li><li>Identifies policy principles and designs to minimize costs; </li><li>Provides a strong and respected analytical basis for representing power industry issues in climate policy discussions;
</li><li>Quantifies the value of technological advances in limiting policy costs and climate risks; and
</li><li>Explores the potential supply and role of emission offsets as a key compliance strategy, as well as new approaches for developing offsets.
</li></ul>
<p>The program’s modeling and analyses provide policymakers with crucial information needed to make economically and environmentally sound climate and energy policy decisions, and also inform members of the possible near-, mid-, and long-term implications of
 different policy approaches, helping them to make better decisions.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program develops and applies innovative policy analysis tools, in house and with leading educational and external research groups from around the world, to inform the public policy discussions. EPRI staff lead collaborative research efforts, such as
 those undertaken by Stanford’s Energy Modeling Forum; play leadership roles in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S. National Climate Assessment; and participate on key U.S. National Research Council, Environmental Protection Agency
 (EPA), and Department of Energy (DOE) scientific panels. This program delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent scenario analyses, published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, that evaluate the implications of key international and domestic policy choices;
</li><li>Study results that can be used to develop presentation materials for internal and external communications;
</li><li>Fundamental insights into the role of technology and the value of technological advances in achieving energy and environmental goals;
</li><li>Multi-stakeholder workshops on climate policy design, emissions offsets, and other topics of interest (such as climate change risks and adaptation) for key leaders and technical staff in industry, federal and state government, international organizations,
 academia, environmental and other NGOs, the financial community, and other stakeholders; and
</li></ul>
<p>An annual session on Energy and Climate Research issues at EPRI ENV-VISION Conference which draws a broad government, research, and industry audience.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s climate policy research has a long track record of effectively informing international and domestic policy decisions. EPRI staff and research have played a critical role, introducing a number of fundamental concepts into policy discussions: the value
 of flexibility in where and when emission reductions are made, the essential role of technology advances in controlling the cost of policy, and the importance of electrification as emission limits tighten. The program has also played a leadership role in the
 analytical community, providing initial and sustained support over the past two decades for MIT’s Global Change Research Program and Battelle’s Joint Institute for Global Change Research. More recent program accomplishments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPRI has been influential in the organization of research efforts through the Energy Modeling Forum, leading to the publication of special-issue journals on U.S. and international climate policy scenarios.
</li><li>EPRI co-chairs the International Energy Workshop, a three-day annual international meeting of 200 energy policy modelers.
</li><li>EPRI researchers have published peer-reviewed papers in numerous publications, including Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences; GHG Market Report 2015, International Emissions Trading Association;
<em>American Economic Review; and Climatic Change</em> </li><li>EPRI researchers have participated in various expert panels, including: 1) Lead authors for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report; 2) National Academies of Science Implication of Tax Code on GHG Emissions Report; 3)
 U.S. National Climate Assessment Report; 4) EPA scientific advisory panel on the carbon neutrality of biomass; 5) National Academy of Sciences panel on the Social Cost of Carbon.

<p>Under the Climate Change Impacts Valuation area, the research conducted under this project would inform federal and other regulatory and policy processes through assessment and analyses of estimates of potential climate damages.&nbsp; Federal and state agencies
 as well as policy leaders are using valuations of avoided climate impacts as justification for climate policy and to set greenhouse gas emissions standards (e.g., the social cost of carbon). This research effort will analyze and assess the underlying studies
 and tools that support climate benefit estimates.&nbsp; This includes social cost of carbon modelling, U.S. specific impacts analyses, individual sector climate impacts studies (e.g., agriculture, cooling and heating requirements, morbidity and mortality, sea level
 rise), and fundamental inputs and tools (e.g., scaling uncertainty, historical uncertainties).</p>
<p>Under the Risk Management area, the research conducted under this project will provide insights into trade-offs between climate risk management costs (mitigation and adaptation) and potential avoided climate risks.&nbsp; Today’s policies and near-term strategies,
 such as regulations, for managing the risk of climate change should include consideration of the stakes and the odds, i.e., costs, value and probability.&nbsp; However, current approaches associated with identifying climate policy objectives pay little attention
 to (a) the major uncertainties surrounding future climate change and the potential impacts of climate change, and (b) the potential costs associated with managing those uncertainties. As such, near-term strategies are not properly informed. The project will
 evaluate alternative characterizations of uncertainties (e.g., socioeconomic development, mitigation costs, physical climate system, and potential climate damages), and analyze hedging strategies that balance mitigation costs, adaptation opportunities, and
 uncertain climate consequences. The research will help evaluate potential implications for near-term decisions, identify circumstances that meaningfully influence decisions, and compare those circumstances to the state of scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Two principal policy initiatives to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs) have created renewed attention on economy-wide analyses approaches: current regulatory efforts under the Clean Air Act (CAA) targeting individual sectors, i.e., electric power, transportation,
 and oil &amp; natural gas; and the U.S. pledge to reduce all GHGs under the Paris Agreement leading to a long-term 80% reduction goal by 2050.&nbsp; Recent analysis have clearly identified a “Gap” between the long-term goal and the estimated reductions from CAA regulations.</p>
<p>Research questions arising from the new policy initiatives to be addressed under Program 102 include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What will be the impact on and contribution from the power sector?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Is CAA sector-by-sector approach incentivizing or dis-incentivizing electrification?</p>
</li><li>
<p>What will various U.S. sectors contribute to overall reductions?</p>
</li><li>
<p>How could national policies impact the power system and consumers at the state and regional level?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Previous economic analyses of economy-wide GHG mitigation point to the cost benefits of
<em>de-carbonizing</em> the power sector first by deploying advanced generation technologies then
<em>electrifying</em> the other sectors of the economy. Understanding and evaluating alternatives to the current carbon policy are important to put forward as policymakers and industry leaders seek out efficient approaches to mitigating GHGs.</p>

<p>In December 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Conference of the Parties (COP21) was held in Paris, France.&nbsp; The meeting concluded with an international agreement that for the first time included greenhouse gas emission
 reduction commitments from most of the world’s countries, including specific pledges from over 185 countries. The agreement also included legal requirements for regular emissions reporting and updating of emissions reduction plans every 5 years.&nbsp; In addition,
 low-carbon technology development, deployment, and finance were recognized as critical to long-run climate goals.</p>
<p>The U.S. reinforced its Nationally Determined Goal to reduce emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 while maintaining the long-term goal of reducing emissions 80% below 2005 levels by 2050.&nbsp;&nbsp; This project will continue its focus on the following
 research questions: How might countries achieve their goals? How might policies interact across countries? How might economic sectors interact within and across countries? How might countries proceed beyond 2025/2030? &nbsp;In addition, the project also will assess
 the importance of clean power technology deployment and how the electrification of end use technologies can mitigate emissions at the global level.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The electric sector faces a near-continuous series of policies and regulations creating compliance requirements that challenge operations and alter investment strategies. The most important is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) ongoing rulemaking
 limiting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from existing fossil generation under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP). Under the CPP, states are required to create plans to implement the rule. While EPA granted states flexibility
 in creating their plans, this flexibility means that states must make a number of fundamental choices such as rate or mass targets, market vs. non-market compliance mechanisms, and how to interact with other states. The many options introduce complexity to
 the plans and place a burden on the states to find the best path. The broad scope of this process, and its uniqueness compared to past regulatory efforts, creates many challenges for the states and increases the risk of unintended consequences. In addition
 to the Clean Power Plan, utilities face great uncertainty over the shape of CO<sub>2</sub> policy beyond 2030, and how that will impact their own investment and business strategies today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal uncertainty over the future of the Clean Power Plan, expected tighter ozone standards, post-2030 CO<sub>2</sub> policy, continued volatility of natural gas prices, rapidly expanding use of intermittent generation, and slow grid-delivered load growth
 (driven by increased energy efficiency, rooftop PV, and natural gas generation) creates a myriad of immediate challenges for electric company decision makers. Should a coal plant be retired, retrofitted, or converted to burn gas? How will the values of current
 assets change as other plants retire and as intermittent generation is integrated into the system? What do the current natural gas prices mean for returns on capital investments, and how could that outlook change? Will increased reliance on natural gas overload
 the gas transmission system at critical times and impact reliability? Will LNG exports drive up natural gas prices? How can the possibility of future energy and environmental policies be usefully included in analyses of near- and long-term decisions? Making
 well-informed decisions requires new information and new ways of analyzing decisions.</p>
<p>In addition, the electric sector is also facing the impacts of novel technologies now, and an accelerating rate of innovation for generation and customer-side technologies for the foreseeable future. The penetration of rooftop solar is stressing existing
 utility business models, increasing distribution costs while lowering net load served, and natural gas distributed generation may play a similar role in the future. Solar and wind generation are expected to increase the variability of the residual load, forcing
 the existing baseload fleet to operate more flexibility. Other nascent technologies continue to receive public or private support, such as storage, small modular reactors, demand response, and distributed generation, but their potential value and limitations
 given the uncertainties are poorly understood. Understanding the tradeoffs between differing technological pathways, independently of any policy drivers, and clearly communicating them can help inform current and future policy discussions and company decision-making.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, the Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) Analysis of Environmental Policy Design, Implementation and Company Strategy program develops and applies advanced modeling tools to provide public- and private-sector decision makers
 with fundamental insights regarding the cost and performance of policy and technology alternatives, for the electric sector and for the overall economy. Since 2012 the highest priority of this program has been to develop understanding and analytical tools
 to help power companies be more effective in participating in the CPP policy making process at the national level, and in the implementation at the state level in the future. The program also develops information, analyses, and tools to help inform company
 strategies in the face of emerging requirements and pervasive uncertainties. Research in this program supports EPRI’s Integrated Energy Network effort though focused pathways to reduce carbon and other emissions.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Well-informed policy choices can help society achieve environmental goals while reducing policy costs. This program has a strong track record of not only performing world-class research but also getting the resulting information into the hands of decision
 makers at the right time. This program analyzes the potential cost and benefit implications of energy and environmental policy proposals, supplying policymakers and electric power industry executives with crucial information for economically and environmentally
 sound policy decisions. It also provides vital insights to help inform company investment decisions and strategies as companies work to comply with new environmental regulations and adapt to the current realities of changing fuel and electricity markets. Companies
 will be investing hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the next decade to comply with energy and environmental regulations. Making well-informed decisions can potentially save companies and ratepayers tens of billions of dollars through lower compliance
 costs and less risky business strategies due to better understanding of potential policy impacts.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program develops and applies innovative policy analysis tools, both in-house and with leading educational and external research groups, to inform public policy discussions and to support company strategy development. It produces methodologies that help
 companies understand how current investment choices may pay off in the short and long run, given the current, very uncertain investment environment. Policy insights are communicated primarily through presentations, briefings, and participation in expert panels.
 Company decision-support results are communicated primarily through webcasts, presentations, briefings, and EPRI technical reports. This program delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear analyses of the key implications, for the electric sector and the economy, of energy and environmental policies;
</li><li>A better understanding of strategies for complying with current and possible future energy and environmental policies, given a wide range of uncertainties;
</li><li>Key insights into robust compliance and investment strategies; and </li><li>A strong track record for getting analysis results to key public and private decision makers.
</li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Policy designs for achieving an environmental goal can vary in cost by billions to trillions of dollars and can significantly affect returns on existing capital and on new corporate investments. Sound analyses and clear communication are critical to creating
 effective, efficient policies and effective corporate strategies. Program accomplishments include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducted 16 webcasts with program members during 2015, all but one focused on a key element of EPA’s regulations for CO<sub>2</sub> and the associated proposed federal plan. Also conducted numerous one-on-one webcasts and conference calls with program
 members. </li><li>Continued development and applications of a multi-region model of the U.S. economy (the U.S. Regional Energy, Greenhouse Gas and Environment model, US-REGEN) including detailed representation of the proposed CO<sub>2</sub> regulations at the individual
 state level. </li><li>Explored practical limits to wind penetration and the long-distance transmission requirement for wide-scale deployment.
</li><li>Developed comprehensive emission control cost data and analytical methods to inform company decisions to retrofit, retire, and/or convert capacity to other fuels such as natural gas.
</li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Program R&amp;D for 2017 will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the costs of specific proposed energy and environmental policies at the regional and national levels to inform policy discussions. The focus will depend upon resolution of expected legal appeals against the Clean Power Plan.&nbsp; If the CPP survives
 appeal, this will include conducting analyses and creating background documents to help members work with their states and fellow utilities to create state plans that are cost-effective, robust with respect to critical uncertainties, and practical and straightforward
 to implement. If the CPP does not survive appeal, the focus will shift to analyzing likely climate policy and regulation, including the possibility of EPA using the Section 115 of the Clean Air Act, and/or other legal avenues for CO<sub>2</sub> regulation.
</li><li>Create information and approaches to help companies update business strategies and evaluate environmental compliance investments in light of an evolving and uncertain environmental policy landscape.
</li><li>Conduct in-depth scenario analyses of specific technology pathways to explore potential implications for the electric sector. The goal is to identify pathways with high costs or benefits, to support discussions on policy options and long-term technology
 development, and help companies evaluate the associated risks. </li></ul>

<p>This project will help members understand and participate within their states in implementing EPA’s Clean Power Plan.&nbsp; In general, this project estimates the economic costs of energy and environmental policies and regulations at the regional and national
 levels as needed to help inform policy development and company decision making. New, proposed, and future EPA regulations; state and regional renewable and climate policies; dramatic changes in fuel markets; and economic uncertainty combine to complicate analysis
 of new policies. Understanding and communicating the combined implications of policies against the backdrop of other key uncertainties is essential for good public and private decision making. Many aspects of combining different forms of policy are poorly
 understood. In particular, a better understanding is needed of the interplay between regulatory and market-based approaches to improve the cost-effectiveness of responses to emission reduction requirements.</p>

<p>Multiple technological directions are being proposed or actively implemented in the electric sector in response to technological innovation and clean energy policies.&nbsp; Some are still hypothetical, others are impacting the U.S. electric sector today.&nbsp; The
 penetration of rooftop solar threatens existing utility business models, increasing distribution costs while lowering net load served.&nbsp; Wind and solar penetration are expected to impact the fossil fleet, creating additional value for those generation units
 able to operate more flexibly.&nbsp; Potential roles for storage, small modular reactors, demand response, and distributed generation are often discussed, but their value and limitations are poorly understood.&nbsp; Understanding the tradeoffs between differing technological
 pathways and clearly communicating them can help inform current and future policy discussions and company decision-making.</p>

<p>The electric sector is undergoing unprecedented change. Tightening environmental regulations combined with volatile natural gas prices, rapidly expanding use of intermittent generation, and slow load growth create a myriad of immediate challenges for electric
 company decision makers. Investment decisions have to be made now, yet the payoff for these decisions is unclear. Electric utility decision makers will need new data, methods, and analytical frameworks to navigate this sea change in their compliance and business
 environment.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Power generating companies are constantly seeking to reduce maintenance-related O&amp;M costs for aging equipment while increasing unit reliability through incremental component improvements. They are challenged by diminishing collective staff experience and
 knowledge and an urgent need to develop new maintenance and engineering staff as the current workforce retires. The training and knowledge needed for new staff is not always readily available from vendors or equipment suppliers in a comprehensive, ready-to-use
 format.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the new mode of operation for many of these older facilities. They were built to be base loaded and provide steady electric power to the grid; now, due to the changing power industry landscape, they are operated in load-following, peaking,
 or seasonal modes. These new modes affect the equipment and systems in the power plant.</p>
<p>New challenges are created for all departments by the addition of new equipment and systems to upgrade the performance and improve the emissions of existing plants. In addition, new combined-cycle combustion turbines, solar, and wind generation assets are
 adding need for innovative development guidance for new types of balance-of-plant (BOP) systems and equipment.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Balance of Plant Systems and Equipment program (Program 104) provides research and guidance for improving overall efficiency and reliability of balance of plant equipment. Using best operations and maintenance
 (O&amp;M) processes, practices, and standards, BOP equipment reliability and cost savings are analyzed and the information is shared with program members. Materials can transfer base knowledge to new workers and is used by experienced staff seeking reliability
 enhancements for maintenance tasks.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI's Generation Operations and Maintenance programs develop advanced processes and technologies that support improved plant reliability and reduced maintenance costs. The programs address the key tactical challenges facing plant owners in predictive maintenance,
 work management, conduct of operations, instrumentation, workforce, condition monitoring, and risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Balance of Plant&nbsp;Systems and Equipment program looks at how these processes and practices are implemented and used in the individual systems and equipment. These programs are highly collaborative in nature, providing forums for EPRI members to jointly
 resolve issues, improve processes, and identify research gaps.</p>
<p>The focus of Program 104 is on enabling all departments and workers to effectively manage a specific system or piece of equipment on a daily basis. Members of Program 104 can use the R&amp;D to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve reliability through guidelines that present the most current technology-based preventive and condition-based maintenance solutions and guidance on department interaction with the system or equipment;
</li><li>Find faster solutions to day-to-day equipment issues by following proven techniques and industry best practices;
</li><li>Develop strategies and guidelines that support troubleshooting and resolve emerging and critical equipment and system issues;
</li><li>Improve staff knowledge and competence through knowledge transfer that addresses industrywide needs;
</li><li>Develop better overall plant practices and reduce human error through the use of clear, easy-to-read equipment guidelines, complete with precautions, safety information, and knowledge from industry operating experiences;
</li><li>Provide general safety topics and processes for BOP equipment and systems, provided in individual sections within the system/equipment guidelines;
</li><li>Achieve reliable performance from new system and component additions driven by both aging equipment replacements; and
</li><li>Provide improved equipment guidance on electrical production equipment, added environmental systems, and BOP components in newly designed power generating units.
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Information is disseminated via equipment guides, field inspection guides, hands-on workshops, and user groups. The Balance of Plant Systems and Equipment program uses equipment research to provide products that enable department personnel to improve the
 daily operation of BOP equipment. Program research and products also work to resolve maintenance, equipment, and reliability problems within the industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical equipment/system guidelines address plant maintenance, operation, engineering, and other interactions with BOP equipment. These technical guides detail not only the equipment, but also related systems and processes. A typical equipment guide will
 include:
<ul>
<li>Equipment descriptions</li><li>Failure modes</li><li>Application information</li><li>Equipment troubleshooting</li><li>Preventive/corrective maintenance tasks and basis</li><li>Equipment-based materials for maintenance, operations, and engineering knowledge transfer</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Access to the program’s web-based Plant Maintenance Basis Database (PMBD) can be used to develop individual plant maintenance bases for reliability improvement and sustaining tasks involving preventive maintenance, condition-based maintenance, and operational
 inspection rounds. The system uses a risk-based customization for each station’s operating scheme.
</li><li>Field inspection guides are developed to help institute or bolster equipment inspection processes.&nbsp; These guides are used in the field by workers conducting the inspection. The guides provide information about critical inspection points and degradations/failures.
 They help create an inspection process that can be followed by any individual and still keep the inspection and documentation in the same format, so data can be consistently gathered, reported, tracked, and trended from inspection to inspection.
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI’s Balance of Plant Systems and Equipment program continues to develop equipment guidelines and process guides that address new and continuing issues facing the industry. Key R&amp;D in this program has included:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 150 maintenance guidelines have been developed for balance of plant equipment and systems. These guidelines provide:
<ul>
<li>Diagnostics and troubleshooting for equipment; </li><li>Maintenance and repair guidance along with preventive maintenance optimal task(s); and
</li><li>Overviews of work planning and job planning templates for equipment; </li></ul>
</li><li>Pocket field inspection guides for BOP equipment/systems that can be used in the field. They provide visual information about critical inspection points and degradations. An example is a field guide for the main condenser;
</li><li>An electronic library with all past research available to all members who join for three or more years;
</li><li>Support for members in resolving plant problems, providing solutions, or linking them to other members with similar experiences;
</li><li>Management of the Fossil Pump User Group; and&nbsp;members have availability to several other EPRI interest and user groups
</li><li>New templates were added to the PMBD and older templates are slated for revisions. A total of 31 new templates were added to the PMBD.
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Key Activities</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program R&amp;D for 2017 will focus on component reliability improvements and sustainability of gains already made through the use of the maintenance guidelines. Building on the program bases around BOP maintenance guides, the program is expanding its depth
 of information and expertise. This increased information will transform the maintenance guidelines into overall equipment/system guidelines.</p>
<p>The Balance of Plant&nbsp;Systems and Equipment program plans to use primary communication pathways such as site visits and webcasts to assist members in learning how to best use the products and transfer EPRI technology. Specific efforts will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Component application guidelines developed each year, based on industry issues and needs;
</li><li>New and revised component templates within the PMBD, so that as component guidelines are created/updated, the information in the PMBD is added to give the members multiple tools to increase plant and equipment efficiency;
</li><li>Provide knowledge transfer and training on the use and benefits of the Preventive Maintenance Basis Database;
</li><li>Webcasts for technology transfer of program research using EPRI products; and
</li><li>Site visits and mini-assessments of material condition at generating stations, with a focus on identifying how EPRI products can provide support to corrective actions and increase equipment reliability and efficiency.

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Strong operational execution in today’s fossil and gas generation plants is critical to achieving highly reliable, safe, economic, and environmentally compliant plant performance. However, consistently achieving a high level of performance in all of these
 areas presents challenges of both a technical and managerial nature. The introduction of additional renewable energy sources, low natural gas prices, stringent environmental regulations, a changing workforce, aging infrastructure and assets, and new technology
 implementation create a fleet that is undergoing a change in mission profiles. And each of these challenges requires a systematic and integrated plant-wide approach to successfully identify and implement solutions that can be easily adopted across an operating
 fleet.</p>
<p>Adding to the challenge of a changing fleet are the everyday operational struggles every plant faces. Work processes, goals and objectives, human performance, personnel development, knowledge transfer, communication, support facilities, plant modification
 and design and management of operational risk – they all play a significant role in overall plant performance. Effective integration of wide-ranging skills and knowledge, work processes, and design — along with strong leadership by the management team — are
 critical to plant success.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Operations Management &amp; Technology program (Program 108) provides a comprehensive portfolio focused on both the technology and human aspects of the fossil and gas fleet, development and evaluation of new and
 improved fossil plant operations technologies, and work policies and practices that raise the standards of operational performance. The program takes a holistic look at an operating plant; instead of focusing on individual components or technologies, the program
 utilizes a broad approach to improve overall plant performance. People, process and technology -- the Operations Management &amp; Technology program looks at these three critical roles, how they can be improved, and where they can be best integrated to reduce
 cost, increase productivity and achieve safe, reliable, cost-effective and environmentally responsible power generation.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI's Operations Management &amp; Technology program develops advanced processes and related technologies that support improved plant reliability and reduced costs. It addresses the key tactical and strategic issues facing fossil and gas plant owners today.
 This program is highly collaborative in nature, providing forums for EPRI members to jointly resolve issues, improve processes, implement technologies and identify research gaps. Members of the program receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidelines that provide tools for excellence in plant operations </li><li>Opportunities for enhanced plant operations through understanding of new technology applications
</li><li>Videos of “What Good ____ Looks Like” </li><li>Forums for industry information exchange and lessons learned </li></ul>
<p>This program focuses on operations technology and human aspects of non-nuclear power generation plants that support improved plant flexibility, reliability and reduced costs. It helps provide best practices, processes, and technologies for power plant operations
 to enable generation providers to meet existing and future challenges in the production of electricity.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program helps operating crews apply industry best practices, improve operational flexibility, implement new technologies, identify vulnerabilities, manage risk, and exchange information with peers. To do this, P108 produces a range of deliverables including
 technical reports and guidelines, newsletters, web-based tools, videos, and technical meetings/webcasts. Specific project selection is based on periodic advisor input and issue prioritization through ongoing interaction with program members. The portfolio
 addresses common and current areas of need such as flexible operations, workforce challenges, human performance, risk management, operational conduct and work management. Members of the Operations Management and Technology Program are integral to project identification,
 scope creation, content development, reviews, and final product publication. They ensure results are timely, relevant and of high quality. Site and plant visits are consistently utilized to understand challenges facing P108 members, develop solutions, and
 identify best practices, creating a culture of true collaboration and learning.</p>
<p>The Annual Operations and Future Perspectives Conference, included with Program 108 membership, provides an open member-run forum for sharing technical knowledge, emerging issues and, O&amp;M best-practices. In addition, program members have access to recorded
 technical webcasts, videos, monthly facilitated technical topic discussions, a quarterly O&amp;M newsletter, and a web-based conduct of operations tool and past product catalog -- all developed to provide easily obtainable information that can be disseminated
 to key staff across an operating fleet.</p>

<p>Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) assessments have always been conducted by seasoned personnel that are knowledgeable in the structure and function of O&amp;M departments at the plant level.&nbsp; These assessments are objective observations of plant processes (both
 policy and execution) as compared to “what good looks like” and established industry best practices.&nbsp; These observations are documented, reviewed, and evaluated to develop an overall assessment report on the plant’s performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>O&amp;M assessments may be tailored to focus on specific areas of concern, but generally include specific aspects of Operations (operator inspections, shift turnover, LOTO execution, etc) and Maintenance (work package development, maintenance task execution,
 schedule adherence, etc) as well as general elements (safety, human performance, housekeeping, etc).</p>

<p>Through experience and learnings over time, the value in identifying standard ways of doing business, or a conduct of operations, has helped the industry adapt and grow. EPRI has published several documents with a focus on conduct of operations, documenting
 good operating principles through the years by review of plants operating histories, incident reports, accident reviews, equipment damage, plant down time and personnel interactions. However, these guidelines have not provided a visual example of how these
 operating principles should be implemented or practiced. For many fossil generating stations, benchmarking outside of an individual unit or a company fleet is not a common practice. The industry needs video tools that demonstrates clear guidance on “What Does
 Good ______&nbsp;Look Like.”</p>

<p>Plant managers face numerous new and growing challenges. Future issues will include new equipment; additional environmental regulations along with lowered existing emissions limits; the need for increased plant operational flexibility such as load following,
 load cycling, and seasonal shutdown; staff turnover and staff reductions; demands for sustained high-performance with a flat O&amp;M budget; needs for more technological support, and more oversight from remote locations. The industry needs to share information
 and experiences in managing the changes that will be necessary for the future work force.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Utilities are increasingly deploying monitoring, communications, computing, and information technologies to enable grid modernization applications such as wide area monitoring and control, asset management, distribution automation, integration of distributed
 energy resources, and demand response. Companies face significant challenges when deploying these technologies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting the technologies that best meet current and future business needs, while minimizing the risk of early obsolescence and vendor lock-in;
</li><li>Creating an overall architecture that integrates the many intelligent devices, communications networks, and enterprise systems to leverage resources and provide information to all users;
</li><li>Mining and managing the tremendous amount of data that is generated, converting the data into actionable information, and effectively presenting the information to the people who need to take action;
</li><li>Managing a growing network of intelligent devices that have different capabilities and use different protocols and data formats in a way that optimizes performance; and
</li><li>Creating pervasive, resilient communications networks that can enable multiple applications
</li></ul>
<p>The Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) Program addresses these challenges by conducting research in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong> – The program accelerates the industry’s migration towards interoperability by making technical contributions to standards development efforts, providing training to utilities, organizing interoperability tests, developing
 transition strategies, and collaborating with utilities on the demonstrations of emerging standards.
</li><li><strong>Communications</strong> – The program provides leadership in communications standards development, provides tracking and analysis of communications technologies, and conducts laboratory and field tests to evaluate the performance of evolving and
 emerging technologies. </li><li><strong>Enterprise Architecture / Systems Integration</strong> – The program creates artifacts that help to improve the state of the art in enterprise architecture and develops guides to help utilities with standards-based systems integration
</li><li><strong>Advanced Metering</strong> – The program leads an industry effort to develop open, interoperable advanced metering systems and develops prognostics tools that can help utilities determine the remaining life of the advanced metering systems.
</li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The ICT program provides information and tools that provide members with immediate value while conducting longer-term R&amp;D to help guide the industry towards a highly connected and interoperable future.</p>
<p>IT departments can receive value from guides that provide best practices for enterprise architecture and systems integration. Utility operations can receive value from reports that track advances in standards and communications technologies; tools that determine
 the remaining useful life of advance metering systems; and from best practices for Geospatial Information System (GIS) and Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data management. This information can enable members to reduce capital and O&amp;M costs, and minimize the
 risk of early obsolescence of equipment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the long term, members benefit from R&amp;D and industry support to advance interoperability standards for advanced metering systems, distributed energy resources, demand response and enterprise system integration. This can reduce capital and integration
 costs and reduce the risk of vendor lock-in.</p>

<p>Utilities are making large investments in equipment and infrastructure that enable applications such as wide area monitoring and control, distribution automation, distributed energy resource integration, and demand response. These investments are highly
 dependent on data and communications standards such as the Common Information Model (CIM), IEC 61850, IEEE 1547, OpenADR, SEP 2.0 and many others. The challenge is that there are many standards available and all are evolving quickly. Many utilities find it
 difficult to track this complex and dynamic landscape that can potentially have a tremendous impact on their business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Communications has become a key requirement for grid modernization and grid transformation. Communications networks are necessary to support generation, transmission, distribution, substations, customer, and market operations. Utilities around the world
 are designing and deploying integrated communications networks that can provide reliable and secure connectivity among intelligent electronic devices throughout their service territories.</p>
<p>The evolution of communications technology is moving at a rapid pace, driven by the expansion of the Internet and advances in mobile telephones and other consumer-focused products. It is critical for utilities to understand the capabilities and limitations
 of current technologies when planning for and investing in their communications infrastructure, and also what new technologies are emerging and the impacts that they might have.</p>

<p>This project set provides technical guidance for information and communication technology (ICT) items of interest to transmission-focused organizations. Utilities continue to invest in sensor technologies that provide real-time information for managing the
 grid and grid assets. Among these are phasor measurement units (PMU) that deliver precise time stamped grid status and also video cameras for substation security monitoring. Both of these technologies require a robust communications infrastructure; however,
 utilities face challenges in putting a comprehensive communications infrastructure in place. For many utilities, their service areas cover expansive geographic areas. The scale and diversity of these areas creates challenges for putting a communications infrastructure
 in place that can be economically justified.</p>
<p>Today there is an ever increasing spectrum of external data sources that may be helpful to utilities. The expansive growth in “Big Data” tools and analytics may provide new efficiencies in transmission operations, planning, and maintenance functions. This
 is especially true with geospatial data that may identify location specific impacts or trends.</p>
<p>Utilities also own a wide array of legacy sensory devices that monitor asset condition with numerous protocols. This array requires a diverse set of mechanisms to get data out of the devices, because many of the legacy devices will continue to be relied
 on for years. As more devices are put online and provide more and more data back to operations, utilities will need to consider adopting standards such as IEC 61850, otherwise known as the Common Information Model (CIM); upgrading their analytic tools to turn
 the raw data into useful actionable information; and actively managing all the data that is being acquired.&nbsp; Proper data management techniques archive aged data and ultimately delete this data when no longer relevant or useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective of the ICT for Transmission Systems project set is to the enhance the situational awareness and asset management of the transmission system by identifying requirements and industry best practices for a robust communications infrastructure;
 developing effective approaches for integrating, managing and analyzing internal and external data sources; and creating a standards-based approach for integrating sensors. The results of this work could ultimately help utilities reduce long-term operations
 and maintenance expenditures and improve system reliability and resiliency.</p>

<p>Utilities are making investments in communications infrastructure to obtain real-time information to enhance the management of both the grid and the grid assets. Many of the new sensors being installed, such as phasor measurement units, use a streaming data
 protocol that “pushes” data out from the device rather than waiting to be “polled” for data. Utilities face challenges in creating a comprehensive communications infrastructure that can accommodate streaming data. They also face challenges in managing the
 tremendous amount of data that will result from streaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project will evaluate two aspects critical to streaming data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the communications infrastructure requirements for streaming data sources such as synchrophasor or video, which requires investigation of data management methods implemented by participating members, and provision of recommendations to improve
 the operational efficiency and management of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second is precision timing, and its impact on keeping high-speed data usable by ensuring adequate precision time measures are in place. Methods to design and ensure reliable time sources will be evaluated.</p>
<p>The work being done in this project is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work being done in the Substations (P37), Grid Operations (P39), and Grid Planning (P40) Programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monitoring asset condition has routinely been accomplished by utilities through substation inspections, field testing, lab testing of samples, and other surveillance methods. As the cost for sensing devices has reduced, installation of sensors and sensor
 systems has proliferated as utilities have used the capabilities to help maintain or improve reliability. Each of these sources of asset condition information tends to utilize its own approach to the organization and naming of data, making it difficult to
 integrate with other systems. Within the Common Information Model, or CIM, and IEC 61850, there exist object models applicable to condition monitoring. Many of the models have been applied in previous work at EPRI in this area; however, in each case compromises
 were made in the approach to accommodate the existing models. This project will take a fresh look at the requirements for asset condition monitoring from the perspective of standards and communications. The work being done in this project is closely coordinated
 with and designed to complement the work being done in the Substations Program (P37) and also supports IEC 61850 working group activity.</p>

<p>The Information and Communication Technology for Distribution Systems project set focuses on the infrastructure, architecture, and standards needed to support the flexible and resilient distribution system of the future. This future distribution system will
 integrate smart devices and workers with back office systems, such as geospatial information systems, distribution management systems, outage management systems, work management systems, asset management systems, and customer information systems. This project
 set will enhance situational awareness by advancing integration among field devices, visualization systems, and back office systems. In doing so, the project set helps inform communications requirements and interoperability standards, and helps establish industry
 best practices. The project set will also address data quality, validation, visualization, and management for real-time applications. The work being done in this project set is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work being done in the

<p>To realize the vision of a modern and integrated grid, distribution utilities need a comprehensive and accurate model of the distribution system that includes the customer-to-transformer connectivity, any grid connected distributed energy resources, protective
 devices, transformers, conductors, and other devices. The data models that form the foundation of the system model must be accurate and kept up- to-date as changes occur on the dynamic grid. In some cases, utilities are finding that their capital intensive
 grid modernization investments are not yielding all of the anticipated benefits. Some utilities are finding that this may be caused by not having a sufficiently accurate representation of the distribution system.</p>

<p>With the digital age, the utility is adapting to new waves of technologies that permit its workforce and devices to be connected in numerous ways. A variety of protocols exist, such as IEC 60870, IEC 61850, MODBUS, DNP3, and others, for distribution communications.
 Other protocols, such as the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Voice over IP (VoIP), and numerous cellular protocols, exist for the connected workforce. The rules for exchanging data among devices
 can drive optimization of the power grid and enable a more efficient workforce. Utilities seek guidance on how to create a comprehensive communications infrastructure that can enable a mobile workforce.</p>
<p>This project will investigate the performance and properties of communications technologies in the context of their ability to support the requirements of different applications used by the connected devices in order to usher in an era of plug-and-play device
 capabilities. Furthermore, many communications media are subject to temporary disruptions or performance degradation due to interference or signal quality issues.</p>
<p>This project will also investigate the effect of the communications disruptions, including error recovery, and the ability of the applications and protocols to handle increased latency and delay. Additionally, the project will seek to document the requirements
 for a more connected workforce, and to identify and demonstrate the wearable technologies that can enable a safer, more knowledgeable workforce.</p>

<p>Distributed energy resources (DER) play a key role in the realization of a modernized grid. EPRI has conducted field demonstration projects, such as the EPRI Smart Grid Demonstration Initiative (SGDI), that have helped to define state-of-the-art practices
 for building a smarter grid. As demand-responsive loads and distributed energy resources continue to be developed and connected to the grid in increasing numbers, this project set provides opportunity to extend collaborative research and information sharing
 in this focused area of research.</p>
<p>This project set will include the integration of DER and DR via both utility owned systems as well as third party-owned cloud-hosted devices and systems of aggregated devices. Research will include the collective impacts of a high penetration of DER including
 renewable resources, distributed generation, and demand response, through full integration supporting interoperability in a utility’s service territory as tools to manage load relief on a distribution system that equate to capacity that does not have to be
 purchased, activated, or constructed.</p>

<p>Distributed energy resources (DER), such as solar photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles, and demand-responsive loads are being connected to the grid in increasing numbers. As additional DER becomes key or even critical components of the grid, appropriate
 and secure protocols and standards need to be created and validated. These DER systems and devices may be owned by the customer, third parties, or the utility. Since these DER systems and devices are not necessarily under the utility’s complete control, DER
 on distribution systems could be disruptive to grid operations or inadequate to provide the desired impact. Utilities will need to understand the DER operational modes that range from &quot;set and forget&quot; to active support (Volt/VAR support from inverters as an
 example) and how those modes and usage models impact the requirements of the communications network. There is also the need to understand the impact of constrained communications (bandwidth and latency) on the control algorithms, the control applications,
 and the application protocols for DER. This will help to define the required level of reliability of the communications system to support different levels of DER. Various issues including autonomous operation of a DER device compared with various centralized
 and distributed control algorithms will also drive the understanding of what communications technologies are appropriate for DER.</p>
<p>The work on interoperability and communications standards in this project is coordinated with and designed to complement the research being done in Energy Storage (P94), End Use Energy Efficiency and Demand Response (P170), and Integration of Distributed
 Renewables (P174) Programs.</p>

<p>Many possible architectures and technologies exist for distributed energy resource (DER) integration, each with certain capabilities and limitations. Some architectures involve deployment and management of utility-owned infrastructure, while others may utilize
 existing systems owned and managed by other entities. Some approaches may require significant effort on the part of the consumer in order to commission and manage, and yet may offer the consumer features that they value. Others may be simpler to deploy, but
 may be limited in terms of the use cases that can be supported. A related architectural issue is to address the pros and cons of autonomous operation of a DER device compared with various centralized and distributed control algorithms.</p>
<p>The focus of this project is on utilization of the standards implemented in devices, or a system of devices, to support a particular utility program requiring or leveraging DER/DR resources. As energy systems and regulatory directives progress, customer
 owned DER/DR will be able to participate to an increased level whether direct or indirect (aggregated) methods are utilized. In addition, manufacturers and third parties may offer a variety of DER/DR communication systems. The granularity of impact management
 of these systems may vary and the ability to access and manage DER devices may be local or regional. With current regulatory directives to enable utilities to accept additional DER it becomes more important to examine which standards and approaches are most
 appropriate.</p>

<p>Developing a solid enterprise architecture is a best practice for aligning business with information technology. To this end, a mature enterprise architecture includes a series of architecture development steps to ensure that any given architecture is informed
 and driven by business requirements, not by the technology du jour. This process creates a “foundation for execution” (accomplished by eliminating redundant systems, harmonizing remaining existing systems) to reduce risk, and increase organizational agility
 over time. While some lines of business may do this upon occasion, an enterprise architecture system is a center of excellence for these practices.</p>
<p>However, few utilities have mature enterprise architecture practices and expertise. Additionally, one of the more popular frameworks for developing enterprise architecture in the utility, The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), does not address any
 given industry, but rather, provides a generic process that then needs to be customized for any given organization that wishes to use it. The key need then is to have a set of best practices or an architecture development methodology that can leverage available
 resource such as TOGAF or other industry references, and then systematically apply them in the utility industry, to provide guidance for utility architecture practitioners.</p>

 proven to be an effective way to accomplish this activity. SOA is not based on a particular technology, but rather can use a variety of means, albeit the
<em>architectures</em> are the same regardless of the specific technology in play. For example, a SOA might use Java Messaging Service (JMS), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or Representative State Transfer (REST). Often SOA is conflated with an Enterprise
 Service Bus (ESB). While a SOA might incorporate an ESB, this is not a requirement but one of many solutions that might be applied to the integration space.</p>
<p>In 2016, this research focuses on SOA use and the maintenance of the interfaces based on SOA. In particular, the project will develop best practices regarding the use of versioning. While the maturity of guidance for systems integration has improved (e.g.
 IEC 61968-100 was published in 2014 that provides Common Information Model (CIM) based integration guidance), there are still questions around the best practices of migrating SOA interfaces to new versions of other software, when, for example, a new version
 of CIM is published.</p>

<p>As devices in the field (operational technology) gain more capabilities that were traditionally the domain of classic information technology (IT) (communication, storage, analytics, applications, platforms), there is pressure for the IT and operational technology
 (OT) functions in utilities to converge. Prior research had identified three strategies for dealing with IT/OT convergence: re-align, re-engage, and re-org. In the same fashion that enterprise architecture can be used to align business and IT, it can also
 be used to align IT and OT. This research will explore the best practices and delve further into these previously identified strategies and examine ways that utilities can best manage convergence both from a technology and an organizational management perspective.</p>

<p>The common information model (CIM) and the families of standards which are represented in the model, is a mature and robust set of standards. Although the use of the CIM in the utility industry has steadily increased, the lack of testing and certification
 has been a drag on the rate of adoption. The international electrotechnical commission (IEC) is efficient at developing and documenting use cases that become the foundation for identifying the functional requirements that are reflected in the standards, but
 the lack of testing and certification leaves the implementation of the standard open to interpretation.</p>

<p>Advanced metering systems are being deployed by utilities worldwide.&nbsp; The performance of these systems, their reliability, and their trust by the consumer are crucial to the utility business. There are many challenges that must be addressed. &nbsp;Solid-state
 metering and communication technologies of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) are new and rapidly evolving, and the methods for optimizing their utilization and value are still developing. Investments in AMI are among the largest being made by utilities,
 resulting in a need for high-quality asset management throughout the system lifecycle. Present systems are largely custom-designed or proprietary, rather than adhering to standards, resulting in vendor lock-in, heightened risk of obsolescence, and lack of
 interoperability.</p>
<p>This project set comprises the whole of EPRI research in metering and advanced metering systems, bringing together communication research and meter-specific research that were previously conducted in separate programs. This project set aids members in optimizing
 existing system utilization and in discovering the full value of AMI-collected data. It accelerates and guides the development of emerging standards and architectures to enhance interoperability, innovation, and marketplace competition. Best practices are
 identified for the support of system operations and monitoring of systems. Solid-state meters are investigated in regard to accuracy, reliability, and tamper resistance.</p>

<p>The present state of the advanced metering industry is depends heavily on custom designs and proprietary systems.&nbsp; Although some standards have been created, maturity is lacking and adoption has been selective so that interoperability and interchangeability
 of devices has not occurred. The result is unnecessary cost and complexity in system design, selection and integration, as well as vendor lock-in that may inhibit innovation and limit functionality.&nbsp; Technology improvements and third-party communication systems
 are rapidly changing the landscape of available options and architectures, furthering the challenges of selecting next-generation technologies.</p>

<p>Best practices for AMI system operation and management are not well known or documented. Utilities are just planning or have recently deployed their first AMI system. For many companies, large network ownership and operation is a new endeavor, and the requisite
 domain expertise is just being developed internally.</p>
<p>AMI systems are made up of thousands, or in some cases millions, of nodes, each of which must remain reliably connected. Data must be collected frequently in order to satisfy billing requirements and support customer service. In spite of this scale and performance,
 the total operating cost must be kept low compared to other communication systems. Service calls for even a small percentage of meters per year are not practical and would be cost-prohibitive on any scale.</p>

<p>AMI systems have the potential to support a wide range of uses and AMI data may provide value across the utility enterprise. AMI data may be processed in innovative ways to improve distribution operations, planning, distributed resource integration, customer
 service, and others. At the present time, these ancillary uses are only beginning to be studied. Performance and capabilities vary from system-to-system, making it difficult to know what options are practical for each. Specific algorithms and system configurations
 that yield the best performance for each system or data use need to be developed and published so that they can be freely and consistently implemented by manufacturers.</p>

<p>The electric power industry has to understand different applications of HVDC well in order to take full advantage of the technology. Applications of HVDC technology are evolving beyond its traditional role of bulk power transfer. Such technologies may include
 converting an ac line to dc, dc cables and improved capacity of voltage-source converter (VSC) technology. Advancements in this technology may lead to new applications. Assessments and evaluations of these new evolving technology are required. Guidelines are
 needed to match application with available approaches and to guide the selection between an ac and a dc system.</p>

<p>The experience working with HVDC lines is significantly lower as compared to the experience working with HVAC lines. HVDC lines have different characteristics than AC transmission lines. These differences need to be addressed during the design and operation
 of the line. Corona from HVDC lines causes audible noise, EMI, ozone production, and spark discharges that may be similar to HVAC lines but the space charge from DC lines i.e. the ejection of electric charge into space, is unique to DC. This space charge results
 in increased DC electric fields, the formation of charged ions and charged aerosols and enhanced human sensations. The space charge also results in dc ion currents to ground and other objects including distribution lines, other utility lines, electrical devices,
 as well as animals and people.&nbsp; This project studies electrical effects from HVDC lines through measurements, characterizations, and quantifications. It also explores electrical effect mitigation measures and develops software to analyze HVDC line designs
 and their expected performance in operations.</p>

<p>Understanding the performance of the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line and its components is critical to building a reliable HVDC line or extending the life of an existing HVDC line. There are plans to build several new HVDC schemes in North America
 and the rest of the world within the next few years. Many of the line designers, however, have limited HVDC experience in specifying, evaluating and applying components on HVDC lines. Many of the existing HVDC schemes operating in North America and the rest
 of the world are over 30 years old. As these lines age, benchmarking HVDC line performance becomes important in order to propose remedial measures to optimize and improve their line performance.</p>

<p>Increasingly high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission is being considered in North America and globally for bringing large volumes of, particularly renewable generation into load centers. Some utilities have significant experience in implementing
 successful and large HVDC projects. However, many of the existing HVDC systems in North America and elsewhere in the world are decades old. Since their implementation the power system has changed, much of the expertise that implemented the legacy projects
 are no longer engaged and the technology has also advanced. Furthermore, many of the proposed new systems are in regions that have previously not had major HVDC systems integrated into their system. There is a need for systematic guidelines for HVDC system
 planning and their application to practical power systems.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Lower prices for natural gas, proposed CO<sub>2</sub> regulations, and the high predicted costs and energy penalties for post-combustion control of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil-fired systems have reduced the near-term need for carbon capture and
 storage (CCS) technologies. But the long-term need is as great as ever; the National Coal Council, in its recent report
<em>Fossil Forward</em> on CCS stated: “Today, deploying CCS/CCUS technology is costly. Tomorrow, not deploying CCS technology will exert an even greater cost, significantly increasing the cost of meeting CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction goals and greatly
 hampering our efforts to do so. Without CCS, it is highly improbable that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction goals will be met. Equally important, without CCS projected costs of achieving these goals will be much higher.”</p>
<p>Accordingly, the emphasis on CCS research at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has shifted from a “What can be done today?” approach to developing cost-cutting breakthroughs in capture while proving the long-term efficacy of CO<sub>2</sub> storage,
 and actively looking for options outside of CCS such as utilization.</p>
<p>For fossil power plants to provide competitively-priced electricity while addressing CO<sub>2</sub> reduction concerns, they need capture processes with parasitic plant loads and costs much lower than those of systems available today. Most power generation
 sources of CO<sub>2</sub> also will need the ability to store large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> safely and permanently in underground formations.</p>
<p>A recent trend has been to consider utilization of captured CO<sub>2</sub> for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Based on current rules in the US, EOR companies will have to comply with a number of EPA geologic storage requirements in order for EOR to receive
 credit as storing CO<sub>2</sub>. More data needs to be gathered to address these requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, there has been an increased interest in utilization of CO<sub>2</sub> for other than EOR in locations that may not have access to EOR or geologic storage. Prior evaluations of this concept suggest that the potential is limited to small niche
 applications, but the concept needs to be further evaluated to determine possible viability in limited or larger-scale applications.</p>
<p>EPRI’s CO<sub>2</sub> Capture, Utilization and Storage program (Program 165) provides information about the expected cost, availability, performance, and technical challenges of a range of flue gas CO<sub>2</sub> capture processes. The program seeks and
 encourages the development of breakthrough post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture technologies with substantially lower energy and cost penalties. In addition, the program conducts R&amp;D needed to demonstrate the permanence, safety, and environmental acceptability
 of long-term CO<sub>2</sub> storage from any power plant source. Also, the program looks at the options for CO<sub>2</sub> utilization, including EOR and non-EOR options. &nbsp;</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Substantial barriers must be overcome, and technical and societal uncertainties must be resolved, before CCS can be widely deployed, but developing such processes can take up to 15 years. At the COP-21 conference, 195 countries agreed that the buildup of
 CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere must be addressed. This program is aimed at assisting the global electric power industry in reducing its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels through research which will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to reduce the cost to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gas </li><li>Reduce the uncertainties related to CO<sub>2</sub> geologic storage </li><li>Continue to monitor for giga-ton-scale CO<sub>2</sub> utilization options </li></ul>
<p>Longer-term, the technology development aspects of this program can help enable the continued supply of affordable, reliable electricity using by fossil-fuel in a low-carbon world.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program pursues parallel, complementary activities in post-combustion capture, utilization, and storage of CO<sub>2</sub> from any fossil-fueled electricity generation source. For post-combustion capture, EPRI will continue to seek potential breakthrough
 technologies that offer the promise of significant cost and energy demand reductions over today’s leading candidates. EPRI then will conduct technical and economic assessments of these processes, followed by development and demonstration of the most promising
 ones, in order to accelerate the availability of commercially mature, cost-acceptable carbon capture methods. For CO<sub>2</sub> storage, EPRI will participate in demonstration projects and focus on reducing the uncertainties involved in geologic storage.
 For CO<sub>2</sub> utilization, EPRI will continue to monitor developments for promising concepts which could have an impact on a climate-changing scale. Members receive this information through three projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>“CO<sub>2</sub> Capture, Utilization and Storage Technology Watch” highlights developments and trends in carbon capture, transport, utilization, and storage through periodic updates on worldwide post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage research.
 Information is obtained through participation in various international forums, workshops, and conferences, and through discussions with technology developers and vendors. In addition, ongoing work in EPRI’s Technology Innovation (TI) program on CO<sub>2</sub>
 capture and demonstration projects is reported in this program. Results are presented to the members through webcasts and presentations at advisory meetings.
</li><li>&nbsp;“Assessments of CO<sub>2</sub> Storage Challenges” summarizes experiences in large-scale storage demonstrations; seeks optimum methods and economics for evaluating potential geologic storage formations; aids in developing improved and cheaper methods for
 monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> underground; and quantifies potential environmental risks (e.g., from migration of injected CO<sub>2</sub> into underground sources of drinking water [USDW] or induced seismic events); and summarizes the regulatory requirements associated
 with conducting CO<sub>2</sub> storage. </li><li>“CO<sub>2</sub> Utilization” summarizes the development of non-EOR CO<sub>2</sub> utilization concepts; the role that CO<sub>2</sub> enhanced oil recovery (EOR) might play in facilitating early deployment of CCS; and technical issues the industry might
 face when converting a CO<sub>2</sub> EOR project to CO<sub>2</sub> storage only. Work in this area will include summary updates of potential concepts, applicability, cost, and market potential.

<p>EPRI provides key technical information on emerging CO<sub>2</sub> capture processes (including post-combustion processes), as well as the feasibility and issues associated with CO<sub>2</sub> transport and geo-storage. Recent R&amp;D highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing and testing of the solvent-based pilot (25 MWe) conducted with EPRI support by Southern Company (SC) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) at Alabama Power’s Plant Barry, and managing the injection and monitoring of more than 100,000 tons of the
 captured CO<sub>2</sub> in a saline reservoir under the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration (SECARB) project. In addition, the High-Efficiency System (HES) system being installed at the site to improve the energy use of the capture process was evaluated.
</li><li>Participation in the National Carbon Capture Center has led to a number of CO<sub>2</sub> capture process evaluations at various scales.
</li><li>Identifying and evaluating the technical feasibility of more than 100 novel CO<sub>2</sub>/flue gas separation concepts or processes under development, narrowing the promising processes to fewer than 20; updating earlier assessments to account for recent
 developments and adding new processes as identified; and providing capsule information and assessments to program members in a web-based database.
</li><li>Providing&nbsp;EPRI members a window into early development status and potential of a wide range of possible CO<sub>2</sub> capture processes — solvent, sorbent, cryogenic, and membrane.
</li><li>Working with&nbsp;sorbent process developers on their test approaches, leading to more technically solid progress towards identification of processing sorbents and sorbent-handling systems that can be used in the power industry.

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Program R&amp;D for 2017 will mainly focus on following developments in the CCS area. For CO<sub>2</sub> capture, this means aggressively seeking new capture process ideas from universities and individual developers; maintaining the program’s database of CO<sub>2</sub>
 capture technologies; and actively supporting selected CO<sub>2</sub> separation process developers with system modeling and power plant insights as they advance their technologies under DOE or state funding. For CO<sub>2</sub> storage, the program will focus
 on white papers to transfer knowledge of potential technologies. For CO<sub>2</sub> utilization, the focus will be on monitoring developments. Key efforts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical and economic assessments of new or emerging post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture processes, including select process simulations.
</li><li>Progress reports on pilot-scale CO<sub>2</sub> capture testing of processes with EPRI involvement.
</li><li>Presentations on the post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture processes being tested at the National Carbon Capture Center (expected to include solvent, sorbent, and membrane processes, possibly including technologies from abroad and new entries to the power
 industry). </li><li>Summary white papers on selected topics. </li><li>Participation in worldwide networks and conferences to discover and monitor new technologies and scientific concepts with the promise of significant reductions in the cost and energy requirements for CO<sub>2</sub> capture, environmental safety and permanence
 of geostorage, and identification of promising CO<sub>2</sub> utilization concepts.
</li><li>Webcasts on topics selected by consensus of the members. </li><li>Participation in a project shared between EPRI Program 66 (Fossil Fleet for Tomorrow) and P165: Combustion Technology Status (summary of large CCS demonstration projects worldwide).

<p>Numerous new process concepts and materials show up “on the radar” each year. So does new information on the development status of these concepts.&nbsp; There is a need to systematically evaluate these technologies to better understand the advantages and challenges
 of each. In response to a lack of a good source of this information, EPRI has created a database of processes which capture CO<sub>2</sub> from power plant flue gas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Credible asset planning through early understanding of the options, development&nbsp;timelines, costs, technical uncertainties, and regulatory, environmental, and related issues
</li><li>Increased&nbsp;confidence that viable capture technologies, storage, and utilization&nbsp;options will be available when needed
</li><li>Use in&nbsp;public dialogue on the practical extent and timing of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction from U.S. power plants, based on neutral, third-party data and&nbsp;assessments from EPRI.
</li></ul>
<p>A key effort in Program 165 is to conduct a technology watch which assesses the status of CCUS technology and tracks important R&amp;D activities around the world.&nbsp; One need identified by members is to provide shorter, but more frequent communication of the
 Tech Watch and R&amp;D results.&nbsp; This will be accomplished via a series of webcasts and short summary reports (3-5 pp).</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The electricity industry must meet customers' continuous demand for power as well as provide safe, reliable, affordable, and environmentally responsible service to customers. Utilities and policy makers in the United States and abroad are increasingly turning
 to energy efficiency as a resource to help address these challenges. Many U.S. states have enacted legislation that mandates specific energy-efficiency savings goals, and some explicitly require utilities to place energy efficiency as the first opportunity
 in their resource planning initiatives. Key to the realization of these goals is the development and adoption of emerging energy-efficient technologies and best practices.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important for utilities to characterize the grid impacts of customer interaction with emerging energy technologies, and to develop platforms for their integration as resources to enable an Integrated Power System. Interaction with the
 ‘connected’ customer that will provide both energy efficiency and demand response benefits that are crucial for the utility of the future.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This program is focused on the assessment, testing, demonstration, deployment, and technology transfer of energy-efficient and demand-responsive end-use technologies to accelerate their adoption into utility programs, influence the progress of codes and
 standards, and ultimately lead to market transformation. The program also develops analytical frameworks essential to utility application of energy efficiency and demand response (DR) in order to enable the Integrated Power System, with particular focus on
 end-use load research and data analytics.</p>
<p>This program provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective, independent technical assessment, testing, and demonstration of emerging end-use technologies for energy efficiency and the enablement of DR technologies.
</li><li>Framework to evaluate the readiness of emerging end-use technologies for utility programs along a research continuum spanning: technology scouting; assessment and lab testing; field testing and demonstration; field pilots; technology transfer; and full
 program rollout. </li><li>World-class laboratory facilities to test emerging end-use technologies in simulated environmental conditions, thereby mitigating members' technical risk for field demonstrations and larger-scale deployments or programs.
</li><li>Multilevel assessment of enabling technologies for DR: components, sensors, and devices; systems for home and building energy management; and program integration into retail and wholesale markets.
</li><li>Development of analytical frameworks to help members characterize end-use load profiles, extract insights from smart meter data and other customer databases.
</li><li>Characterization of the grid impacts of customer interaction with emerging energy technologies and development of platforms for their integration as resources to enable an Integrated Power System.
</li><li>Technical staff with expertise in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC); lighting; water heating; motors; power electronics; data centers; building energy management systems and controls; smart end-use systems; and analytical frameworks for
 energy efficiency and demand response. </li></ul>
<p>This program advances the efficient use of energy, helping to keep electric service affordable for customers and environmentally responsible for society through resource conservation and avoided emissions. It also facilitates the connected customer getting
 more value from their utility service.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program uses the following approach to address the research gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate the performance of emerging end-use technologies—for example, energy savings and peak demand reduction, reliability, and compatibility—to develop savings impacts to accelerate their adoption into programs and markets.
</li><li>Update the <em>Energy Efficiency Technology Readiness Guide</em>, a compendium of technical, economic, and market readiness information for a comprehensive set of end-use technology categories, to serve as a convenient reference for utility energy-efficiency
 and demand response professionals. </li><li>Assess emerging energy efficiency and demand response technologies that could potentially support the Integrated Power System.
</li><li>Conduct large-scale, multiyear field deployment of advanced energy-efficient technologies.
</li><li>Produce in-depth technical reports and guidebooks and provide knowledge transfer through concise technical briefs, fact sheets, newsletters, and topical webinars throughout the year to members' staff and their end use customers.
</li><li>Identify gaps and barriers to using AMI and other customer databases for development of analytics applications to derive utility and customer benefit. Showcase successful implementation of such applications.
</li></ul>
<p>Further, this program supports one of EPRI’s Research Imperatives to “Enable Integration of Customer Resources” by addressing the following research gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characterizing grid impacts of emerging energy efficiency and demand response technologies;
</li><li>Integrating energy efficiency and demand response resources into grid operations.
</li></ul>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The research conducted through this program has helped members mitigate risk and avoid costs through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment, testing, demonstration, and field pilots of emerging energy-efficient and demand-responsive technologies and systems to determine efficacy prior to deployments in utility programs.
</li><li>Synthesis of end-use load research results and techniques to provide predictive insights into electricity use forecasts.
</li><li>AMI data analytics to provide valuable customer insights that can help improve customer satisfaction and utility operations.
</li><li>Technology transfer through readiness guides, workshops, technical briefs and newsletters.
</li></ul>
<p>The program has also provided significant input towards the development of functional specifications for “demand-response-ready” (“DR-Ready”) end-use devices, including the definition of use cases and DR performance attributes. EPRI has facilitated a multidisciplinary
 dialogue on DR-Ready devices involving utilities, equipment manufacturers, public agencies and other industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>Finally, EPRI’s annual Technology Readiness Guides (2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 editions) have benchmarked the maturity of technologies with respect to EPRI's energy efficiency technology development pipeline. They include comprehensive assessments of technologies,
 including detailed scoring criteria and estimates of energy savings potential.</p>

<p>This project set takes a holistic look at demand response programs and technologies.&nbsp; Some of the key research questions pertaining to demand response technologies addressed by this project set include:</p>
<p>What are the capabilities required of mass market end use devices such as water heaters, thermostats, pool pumps and appliances for them to be “DR-Ready”, i.e., provide DR capabilities out of the box?&nbsp; How can the utility requirements be harmonized with
 those of manufacturers to develop standards for DR-Ready devices?&nbsp; How can thermal energy storage, both active and passive enable the grid to better align supply and demand on the grid?</p>
<p>This project set also addresses demand response research at a more systematic level, addressing questions such as: What is the capability of building control systems to provide energy efficiency and demand response and what is the persistence of the measures?&nbsp;
 What are the technology requirements to better enable the evolution of DR markets and enable utility participation in the markets?</p>
<p>Further, this program supports one of EPRI’s Research Imperatives to “Enable Integration of Customer Resources”</p>
<p>The work being done in this program is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work undertaken in the Electric Transportation (P18), Energy Storage and Distributed Generation (P94), Information and Communication Technology (P161), Distribution
 Systems (P180), Integration of Distributed Energy Resources (P174), and Understanding Electric Utility Customers (P182) Programs.</p>

<p>Questions surround the capabilities required of mass market end-use devices such as water heaters, thermostats, pool pumps and appliances to be supportive of power system and market needs. To inform utility understanding of potential benefits and impacts
 of connected mass market end-use devices, the device capabilties need to be understood. Moreover, industry consensus is needed on what requirements for these devices could constitute being Demand Response-Ready (“DR-Ready”), with recognized capabilities supportive
 of the grid. Harmonization of utility requirements with physical product capabilities supported by manufacturers is also critical towards development of standards for DR-Ready devices.</p>

<p>Heat Pump Water Heaters are beginning to gain traction in the residential sector, and regulation is beginning to push their adoption. Commercial heat pump water heaters have been slower to catch on, and have seen market and technical barriers. There are
 key research questions in both spaces: in residential water heating, how can HPWHs become more cost-effective, more efficient and more grid-responsive? Will increasing market growth prompt new innovation within the sector?&nbsp; For commercial water heating, how
 can systems become more cost-effective, such that they are more readily adopted into new construction? What can be done to make them easier to deploy in retrofits? Can pre-engineered packages be deployed for common buildings and applications?</p>

<p>Do networked lighting controls provide reliable energy savings in all applications? Are controls consistent in operation across installations and manufacturers? Evaluating lighting controls for their functionality and compatibility with various lighting
 sources will enhance EE and DR programs. EPRI lighting researchers are working with the industry to develop and test innovative approaches for lighting to be an integral part of load management programs. EPRI’s lighting research is exploring these questions
 in its base research and will continue to address these issues in 2017 and beyond.</p>

<p>As utilities strive to meet increasing end-use energy efficiency and demand response requirements, they must make decisions about which technologies seem most promising in terms of availability for wide deployment and providing persistent energy savings
 and demand reduction, while also being cost-effective and likely to be adopted by customers. Utilities are also interested to understand the grid impacts of such technologies. To help utilities with these understandings, EPRI has developed, and continues to
 expand, this Technology Readiness Guide (TRG) to provide a readiness assessment of technologies in various stages of development as well as enabling comparison among these.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Installed capacity of renewable energy have increased significantly over the last decade due to policy decisions such as state-mandated renewable energy standards and federal air and water standards, along with improved economic viability for these resources.
 Much of the existing and estimated development of renewables comprises variable resources such as wind generation and solar photovoltaics (PV), which when integrated with the grid, create new challenges for maintaining reliable system operation. Future projections
 are that a more significant build-out of these variable renewable resources is likely at both the transmission and distribution levels.</p>
<p>With these developments, power system planners and operators require new tools and resources to provide a reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective supply of electricity to consumers. Tools to aid in meeting these objectives include (1) improved and/or new
 sources of system flexibility to respond to and accommodate the increase in energy variability and uncertainty, (2) the development of additional transmission infrastructure to deliver energy from remote locations, and (3) planning and operational methods
 and software to effectively plan and operate the bulk system with these new resources, many of which may be at the distribution level. EPRI’s Bulk Power System Integration of Variable Generation (VG) research program addresses these needs and directly supports
 EPRI’s Research Imperatives #2 “Integration of Dynamic Customer Resources and Behavior” and #3 “Integrated Power System and Environmental Modeling Framework.”</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Bulk Power System Variable Generation Integration research program provides variable generation integration analytics; development of planning and protection methods, tools, and models; and development of operator methods and tools to reliably and economically
 integrate wind and solar PV generation. This is accomplished through a collaborative process wherein EPRI works with its utility and independent system operator (ISO) members and other stakeholders to identify existing research gaps and associated project
 needs that would provide value to society and to EPRI members. Once identified, the EPRI Bulk Variable Generation Integration team of technical and project management experts works with members and the world’s foremost experts in related research areas to
 structure and conduct specific projects that delivers value in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term. Finally, this value is transferred to members through collaborative advisory and task force interactions, workshops and webcasts, and specific applications
 and demonstrations of the developed methods and tools.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI's Bulk Power System Variable Generation Integration research program delivers value by using the shared experiences and understanding of EPRI's utility and ISO members in conjunction with the expertise of EPRI's staff and network of contractors. The
 program conducts research projects that lead to methods and tools used by system planners and operators responding to the challenges of high penetrations of VG. These prototype methods and tools are applied and validated by members before being transferred
 to commercial vendors that supply and support member applications.</p>
<p>EPRI also engages with external industry standards, regulatory, and research efforts to ensure that the EPRI research program is taking advantage of broader industry efforts and advancing the state of the art. For example, EPRI staff participates in North
 American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Essential Reliability Services Working Group (ERSWG), Utility Variable Generation Integration Group (UVIG), and related IEEE and CIGRE working groups to inform the requirements that emerge from such efforts.</p>
<p>EPRI's research program strives to provide societal benefits by ensuring that utilities and ISOs can provide a reliable, economic, and sustainable electricity supply that ensure public safety and an promotes economic activity. The program supports member
 utility and ISO goals to deliver this electricity supply to the public by providing research results that address near-term, mid-term, and long-term gaps. For example, the 2017 Bulk System Variable Generation Integration research program will continue efforts
 to validate inverter-based short-circuit models for wind and PV facilities that are integrated into commercial tool for protection studies today. At the same time, we are conducting research to develop operator tools and techniques that will improve generation
 dispatch and reserve procurement based on the probabilistic nature of wind and solar, and developing operational flexibility assessment and resource evaluations tools for planning the investments needed to ensure sufficient ramping capability exists in the
 future.</p>
<p>This program is managed together with the Grid Operations (P39) and Grid Planning (P40) programs, and coordinates with related areas across EPRI, including Program 174 (Distributed Energy Resource Integration), Program 94 (Energy Storage) and Program 178
 (Technology Assessment, Market Analysis and Integrated Portfolio Planning).&nbsp;&nbsp; Where appropriate, we define and create joint deliverables that leverage the expertise and learnings from these other programs with the relevant Grid Ops &amp; Planning research and
 experts to deliver R&amp;D results that benefit both areas.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Bulk Power System Integration of Variable Generation program began in 2010, and has provided significant industry leadership and helped create valuable reports and tools in a number of areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Generic Models and Model Validation for Wind, Solar PV Generation, and Energy Storage (3002005731, 3002006525, 3002001002, 3002003351):</em> These deliverables (reports, guidelines and a video) describe the recommended generic wind turbine, PV, and
 energy storage dynamic models developed through industry efforts with significant leadership from EPRI, as well as the related model validation efforts conducted by EPRI. This work has already resulted in the inclusion of improved generic models in existing
 commercial dynamic stability software packages. </li><li><em>Renewable Energy Model Validation (REMV) Tool Version 2.0 (3002003352): </em>
This software tool takes wind and solar PV plant disturbance response measurement data as an input and provides for automated validation of the associated dynamic model or provides optimized model parameter values to obtain a validated model.
</li><li><em>Impact of Renewables on System Protection </em><em>(</em>3002005765, <em>
3002002810):</em> These reports describe electromagnetic transient type (EMT-type), time domain and associated frequency domain models of converter interfaced wind turbines and solar PV that can be used for short circuit studies to determine how they affect
 system protection. Additionally guidelines for conducting protection studies with high levels of inverter-based renewables are provided.
</li><li><em>Voltage and Frequency Performance and Modeling of DER (3002007496, 3002005768, and 3002004697):
</em>These reports provide updates to a project focused on understanding potential impacts of high levels of VG on the bulk system voltage and frequency performance, including methodology development, case study results and recommendations on mitigating strategies.
 This project also examined the need for interconnection requirements and modeling approaches and recommendations for representing Active Distribution Systems in transmission models.
</li><li><em>Operating Reserve Determination (3002006112, 3002002871):</em> These reports provide updates to a project focused on understanding approaches for procuring operating reserve to manage the variability and uncertainty of variable generation. This includes
 the use of stochastic programming and multi-cycle modeling approaches to examine the benefits of new reserve procurement strategies compared to more advanced scheduling strategies. .
</li><li><em>Power System Flexibility (3002005763, 3002005764, and 3002003581):</em> These deliverables (reports and video) outline a framework to assist planners in assessing the system operational flexibility to meet increased ramping requirements associated with
 wind and PV. A set of metrics to calculate a system’s operational flexibility sufficiency were defined and demonstrated using case studies. Additionally, methods to determine the resource adequacy implications of variability and uncertainty were demonstrated.
 A video explains the concepts for general audience. </li><li><em>InFLEXion Flexibility Screening and Assessment Tool </em><em>v 4 (</em>3002005760) and
<em>v3.0 (3002004486</em><em>): </em>This software tool is designed to assist planners in assessing operational flexibility of systems. The multi-level approach takes data such as time series of wind and load and generator characteristics and performs a screening
 analysis of flexibility requirements and resources, while it can be used with detailed generation dispatch data to calculate flexibility adequacy metrics.

 that can be reliably operated with increasing penetrations of these resources. This project set includes research to provide these new models, tools, and methods.</p>

<p>Computer simulation models of power systems are needed to facilitate an effective and reliable means of planning, designing, and operating the bulk power system.&nbsp; Although the level of installed wind and photovoltaic (PV) generation is increasing substantially,
 validated, publicly available models that represent the behavior of many of these technologies are still trailing.&nbsp; This project provides for the on-going research needed to ensure that the wind, PV, energy storage and other renewable related models for planning
 studies are developed, validated, and made available to commercial software vendors for inclusion in the tools used by member utilities and ISOs. This R&amp;D work addresses modeling and validation of resources connected at the transmission/sub-transmission system

<p>The integration of renewable energy resources into power systems introduces several technical challenges. One major challenge is the impact on system protection, resulting from the complex fault response characteristics of these devices which are interfaced
 with the grid through power electronics-based converters and do not behave similar to conventional synchronous or asynchronous machines. There are two aspects related to this challenge that need to be investigated. First is the modeling of converter interfaced
 renewable resources in fault and protection system analysis tools used in protection studies. Traditional short-circuit modeling techniques are not adequate and there is an industry need for the development of short-circuit phasor-domain models of these devices
 that accurately represent their short circuit contribution to the system fault response and can be used for fault analysis and system protection studies. The second aspect is the performance of legacy protection schemes in systems with high levels of renewables,
 and potential mis-operations which will reduce the reliability of the grid. An understanding of the way these devices affect system protection is needed so that protection and planning engineers design the protection schemes appropriately without jeopardizing
 the security of the system.</p>

<p>This project set focuses on developing methods and tools to improve efficiency and reliability of system operations in the presence of high levels of wind and solar. Two separate types of tools and methods are being investigated. The first area is operational
 planning tools being developed to allow operators efficiently manage the variability and associated with wind and PV. These tools are based on stochastic optimization and other advanced operational simulation techniques, and will allow operators to more reliably
 and efficiently schedule resources and understand the impact of various potential operational processes proposed to integrate wind and solar. This includes more optimal methods of procuring and deploying operating reserves as well as methods to utilize probabilistic
 forecasting and improve integration of forecasting in system operations.</p>
<p>The second area in this set is related to the real-time operational reliability impacts of wind and PV on system voltage control and frequency response and control. As variable generation resources displace traditional resources that provide frequency response
 and control, there is a need for bulk system operators to understand frequency response of the system, including the primary frequency response and inertia, as well as the interaction between primary frequency response and secondary frequency control. It will
 become increasingly important to track operational metrics and have the capability to model different scenarios that may occur. This project set is ensuring that the impacts on operations are well understood and can be mitigated. The inverter-based resources
 can themselves support bulk system reactive power/voltage control and frequency response and this capability will also be evaluated, with results helping operators to understand the use of these stochastic resources in operations.</p>

<p>The variability and uncertainty associated with variable renewable generation such as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV), energy efficiency measures, and new demand response resources can have a significant impact on system performance and operation as penetration
 levels increase. Specifically, variability and uncertainty intensify the challenge for system operators to forecast and schedule the most economical set of resources for meeting system energy demands while maintaining reliability. Consequently, new operational
 scheduling, forecasting, control methods, and analysis tools are needed to ensure the future system can be operated in a reliable and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Traditional approaches for system operations manage the limited uncertainty associated with demand forecast error through offline analysis with periodic updates (e.g. on an annual basis). With a changing underlying demand, as well as a large and growing
 penetration of variable generators, a system operator’s risk exposure greatly increases. Following traditional approaches may no longer be feasible from a cost or reliability viewpoint. This project focuses on addressing the need to manage increasing uncertainty
 and variability in system operations at least cost, through leveraging new tools and scheduling methods to ensure that the changing generation and demand mix can be balanced at least cost while not impacting system reliability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>High penetration of renewable generation presents challenges in the planning and operations of power systems. Ensuring adequate frequency and voltage response are examples of such challenges as the generation mix changes with increase in penetration of inverter-based
 variable generation and planned retirements of fossil-fueled generation or as remaining conventional generation is displaced. Conversely, opportunities need to be explored to utilize emerging technologies such as inverter-based wind and photovoltaic (PV) resources,
 energy storage and demand response for contributing to voltage and frequency response. Thus, the industry needs to investigate the impact on system frequency and voltage performance as traditional resources that support these functions are displaced and investigate
 and demonstrated the ability of newer and less familiar resources to provide frequency and voltage support.&nbsp; This investigation is complicated by the fact that some of the potential bulk system impacts may be driven by distribution-connected resources that
 are not readily modeled in bulk system simulation models.</p>

<p>This project set provides methods and tools which consider the operational flexibility needs of systems with increased penetrations of variable generation. The variability and uncertainty related to wind and solar PV will require increased levels of operational
 flexibility to be accounted for in the planning time-frame. This will require metrics, methods and tools which can assess the increased requirements and identify needs. These metrics and tools will provide planners with the ability to determine whether a system
 is sufficiently flexible and will adequately consider and compare different resource types including conventional generation, demand response and energy storage. It will also provide methods to consider how the transmission system (both existing and new lines)
 can be included in the assessment of operational flexibility, and provide insights into how operational processes can be considered in the planning time-frame to ensure flexibility can be accessed. The resulting processes and tools can be used to ensure reliable,
 efficient integration of variable generation into the bulk system.</p>

<p>With increased levels of variable generation (VG) and other potential changes to the system, such as coal retirement and increased reliance on natural gas, ensuring that systems have sufficient operational flexibility has become a strategic issue. In systems
 with high levels of production variability and uncertainty, flexible resources will be required to meet reliability targets by enabling the system to respond effectively to load or generation changes and to reduce the cost impacts of integrating large amounts
 of VG. Methods are required to assess whether sufficient resources exist to meet changes in net load (demand net of VG), and to ensure planning processes adequately consider flexibility. The need for flexibility must be balanced with the cost associated with
 increasing system flexibility.</p>
<p>Prior research in this project developed a flexibility assessment framework including proposed new flexibility metrics, examined the impact transmission has on provision of flexibility, and proposed methods to consider flexibility in resource adequacy studies.
 A software tool, InFLEXion, was produced to demonstrate application of the methods.</p>
<p>Work is also being done by tool vendors and utilities/ISOs to incorporate flexibility issues into their planning processes (for example significant work is being done in California). The metrics and methods developed here are designed to work in conjunction
 with these tools/methods, and in certain cases, build on existing work or improve those methods. In addition, the framework developed allows project participants to understand what these tools need to consider and helps to validate new techniques for considering
 flexibility in planning.</p>

<p>Bulk system renewable integration technology transfer provides members with resources that convey the latest industry developments on integration issues, standards activities, and changes in technology, advancements, and challenges. They provide utility
 and ISO transmission planners, protection engineers, and operators with the insights as to the latest industry research related to renewables integration including integration study results, emerging standards, and new analysis/integration methods and tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that as this project set is designed to complement EPRI’s Integrated Grid efforts and other Project Sets in Program 173, and as such is not a full R&amp;D project, members who join this but not one of the other Program 173 Project Sets will not have access
 to the related program-level task force, including webcasts and in-person meetings.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Increased amounts of distributed energy resources (DER) in the electric grid brings a number of challenges for the electric industry. Utilities may face large numbers of interconnection requests; distributed generation on some circuits will exceed the load;
 and many operating challenges involving feeder voltage regulation, hosting capacity limits, inverter grid support and grounding options are brought to bear. Furthermore, providing reliable service as DER penetrations increase and electricity sales diminish
 can also add economic challenges to the technical ones.</p>
<p>This Program addresses the aforementioned challenges with project sets that assess feeder impacts, inverter interface electronics, interconnection and communication standards, and integration analytics. The Program provides insights into utility interconnection
 practices and strategies related to future integration approaches. It also evaluates economic impacts and values of DER integration. Many of these activities support EPRI’s “The Integrated Grid” initiative.</p>
<p>Finally, the Program includes laboratory and field evaluations and demonstrations of improved DER power management and communications. A primary objective of the work in the field is to expand utility hands-on knowledge for managing distributed energy resources—without
 reducing safety, reliability, or asset utilization effectiveness.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This research program addresses four main areas of distributed energy resource integration:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analytics to understand feeder impacts and benefits; integration of these analytics with distribution planning tools and methods;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Devices and controls for effective DER interconnections and coordination;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Practices that address the economics of DER integration; and</p>
</li><li>
<p>Industry coordination and technical transfer.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>All projects build on and expand previous work related to DER integration. A range of products are identified for each project. Participants' input and prioritization will determine the final research investment and deliverable plan.</p>
<p>The work being done in this program is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work undertaken in the Energy Storage and Distributed Generation (P94), Information and Communication Technology (P161), Energy Efficiency and Demand Response
 (P170), Technology Assessment, Market Analysis, and Generation Planning (P178), Distribution Systems (P180), Distribution Operations and Planning (P200) and Renewable Generation (P193) Programs.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Integration of DER program has delivered valuable information to members and industry. Results of the 2015 program are described in an annual summary (3002007299). Following are examples of program outcomes to date:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Updated and improved engineering guide</em>. This guide is intended for utility engineers facing integration of distributed generation and storage. The guide is intended to serve as a reference for interconnection practices, provide criteria and approaches
 for screening installations, and suggest methods for planning with significant DSG. (3002005774)</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Methodology for quantifying the impacts of PV on the distribution system and demonstrated examples of its application</em>. This product provides examples of the Integrated Grid benefit-cost analysis framework, applied across an entire utility distribution
 system in the Southeast. Mitigation measures are analyzed for all distribution feeders, while six diverse feeders are evaluated in detail to analyze capacity deferral value and energy loss assessment. Subsequent results are then extrapolated to the entire
 set of distribution feeders to determine the economic implications of adding distributed PV to the distribution system. (3002005783).</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Quarterly Solar PV Market Updates</em>. The Updates, provide snapshots of PV market information, along with EPRI analyses, to inform utility members about economic-, policy-, and technology-related developments in the segment. The documents synthesize
 data on market outlooks, equipment cost and pricing trends, system design and efficiency advances, and changes in the incentive landscape, that are likely to impact utility solar PV investment and planning efforts. (3002005776, 3002005777, 3002005778, 3002005779).</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Multi-year project evaluating the performance of multiple smart inverters operating in parallel.</em> Smart inverters of different makes and models are being tested in the laboratory in a real world deployment scenarios. In 2015, research provided an
 update on a residential solar neighborhood test setup. Initial test results of two smart string inverters operating in parallel are included in the update. The impact of fixed power factor, low voltage ride thru (LVRT), volt-var, and volt-watt with volt-var
 functions were also investigated. (3002005784).</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Technical support to IEEE P1547 full revision process.</em> EPRI subject matter experts facilitated the voltage regulation and abnormal voltage and frequency condition subgroups. These subgroups developed new requirements for DER voltage regulation support
 and also low- and high voltage and frequency ride through requirements, which are expected to be included in the next version of the IEEE 1547 DER interconnection standard. Members were updated throughout the year through webcasts.</p>

<p>This project set provides the analytics needed to address both existing distribution issues and future options and concepts with higher penetration of distributed energy resources (DER).&nbsp; It focuses on the readiness of the distribution system—both radial
 and network distribution—for incremental increases in distributed generation.&nbsp; Several products will directly support work on “The Integrated Grid.”</p>
<p>Most existing radial and network distribution systems are not designed for a significant penetration of distributed energy resources (DER).&nbsp; Standards that address the interconnection of distributed generation (for example, IEEE 1547-2003) assume low penetration
 levels.&nbsp; The industry recognizes that these requirements are changing with a more robust deployment of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in many utility systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decisions on replacing or upgrading aging distribution systems will require considering the potential for higher levels of DER.&nbsp; Utilities would also like to plan for and build in capability to support higher DER penetration levels while maintaining safety,
 protection, and reliability in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>The work being done in this project set is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work being done in the &nbsp;Energy Storage and Distributed Generation (P94), Bulk Power System Integration of Variable Generation (P173), Distribution Operations

<p>With the proliferation of distribution-connected generation sources, especially renewables, it is a necessity that DER be capable of providing grid-supportive functions that minimize their disruptive impact and support distribution operations, ultimately
 enabling higher levels of renewable energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; In prior years, this project set has oriented the utility industry toward this goal, but several challenges remain. The next steps are critical, including how DER aggregation is performed, which functions are active
 simultaneously, their response time and transient behaviors, and how many/multiple devices of differing types and brands interact to produce an overall grid impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These resources, which include photovoltaic (PV) generation and energy storage systems, have significant processing power and potentially fast response times, making both steady-state and dynamic grid benefits possible.&nbsp; Utilities and manufacturers need
 accurate, unbiased information to guide their development and integration efforts.&nbsp; Meanwhile, procedures are underway to revise DER interconnection standards that are the basis for grid codes everywhere, such as IEEE 1547 and UL 1741, and yet little is known
 about how aggregation will be performed and how required functions will actually be implemented in products.</p>
<p>The work being done in this program is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work undertaken in Energy Storage and Distributed Generation (P94), Information and Communication Technology (P161), Energy Efficiency and Demand Response (P170),
 Distribution Systems (P180), and Distribution Operations and Planning (P200).</p>
<p>The functional requirements identified in this project are used by the EPRI Information and Communication Technology program (P161D) to guide the development of communication protocols, standards, and architectures that support the needs of smart inverters.</p>

<p>With increasing deployment of these systems, many utilities are making investments in related communications technology.&nbsp; With the introduction of many new grid interface systems, there is an increasing need to analyze and understand their operation and
 performance.&nbsp; The next steps are critical, including how DER aggregation is performed, which functions are active simultaneously, their response time and transient behaviors, and how many/multiple devices of differing types and brands interact to produce an
 overall grid impact.&nbsp; A better understanding of standards and safety practices is critical.</p>
<p>This project set focuses on devices including inverters, controllers, and other related intertie technologies that provide the end-user-level distributed energy resource integration with the grid.&nbsp; It focuses on evaluating grid functionalities for these
 devices, and it evaluates both the electrical power and communication interfaces for DER and advanced inverter functions.&nbsp; The project set includes development of performance criteria, laboratory, and field testing.</p>

<p>As utilities contemplate the integration and use of an expanding amount of distributed energy resources (DER) on the distribution system, they will be confronted by new system performance, reliability, and operating challenges. Accelerating adoption of solar
 PV specifically poses a range of business-related impacts that have economic implications. Increasing levels of DER generation have cost and benefit implications for customers and society, but are not yet well understood. Tracking DER market developments and
 integration activities, implementing informed management strategies, and forecasting DER adoption trajectories, will together be increasingly required to effectively guide utility strategic planning and business-related decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project set examines the economic implications of DER—primarily solar photovoltaics (PV)—and assesses leading practices for tactically accommodating higher penetrations of variable resources on distribution. In addition, it offers insight into the technical,
 economic, and market adoption potential of customer-sided PV to help inform utility planning activities. These activities are key components of “The Integrated Grid.”&nbsp; Research coverage encompasses: PV integration approaches and associated cost-benefit analyses,
 utility solar business model design and mechanics, output variability forecasting and mitigation techniques, as well as end-use PV adoption estimation methods.</p>
<p>The research in this project set is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work undertaken in EPRI’s Energy Storage and Distributed Generation (P94), Technology Assessment, Market Analysis, and Generation Planning (P178), and Renewable Generation
 (P193) Programs.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The electric sector today in the United States and around the world is undergoing a profound transformation that is driving unprecedented changes to company operations, corporate environmental compliance, resource planning, business strategy, and industry
 structure. This transformation results from the interplay of (i) dramatic changes in the technical performance and cost of power generation technologies, such as wind and solar; (ii) increased deployment of utility-scale wind and solar resources and distributed
 energy resources (DER); (iii) federal and state regulatory actions designed to increase deployment of renewables and distributed resources, and to dramatically reduce GHG emissions from new and existing power plants; and, (iv) sustained, low natural gas prices.</p>
<p>In recent years, the interplay of several of these factors caused dramatic changes to the dispatch of power plants in many U.S. regions. These changes in dispatch led to increased cycling and idling of base load coal plants along with an increasing number
 of coal plant retirements, and reduced dispatch and closure of some existing nuclear units. At the same time, natural gas fired power plants are being dispatched more than ever before, and many companies are considering investing in new natural gas-fired power
 plants to meet future capacity needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the traditional relationship between electric companies and their customers is undergoing a similar transformation. In recent years, companies have faced slow and uncertain load growth, and new distributed generation, storage, and grid technologies
 are creating new business paradigms and reducing demand for grid-delivered power.&nbsp; The advent of two-way power flow and the development of the “integrated grid” is leading to greater interaction between electric companies and customers, and consumer behavior
 is changing in response to changing regulatory drivers, the availability of competitively priced distributed resources, and the deployment of new consumer technologies, such as “smart” phones, rooftop solar PV and electric cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sound data and information and new analysis methods and tools that can be used to incorporate these factors into long-range resource planning are critical for companies to continue to provide safe, affordable, reliable, and environmentally responsible electricity.&nbsp;
 As this transformation of the electric sector continues to unfold, company resource planners and fuel managers will continue to be confronted with a variety of new planning challenges that require access to up-to-date information on the cost and performance
 of existing and new electric generation technologies and development and use of new analytic methods to effectively address emerging resource planning challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internationally, electric companies also face a daunting array of resource planning challenges. Market liberalization policies adopted in some parts of the world are leading to the privatization and breakup of previously state-owned monopoly electric companies.
 Increasing industrialization and consumer expectations, particularly in the developing world, are dramatically increasing electric loads. International policies designed to reduce GHG emissions and increasing pressure to adopt “low-carbon” development pathways
 are leading electricity planners in many countries to reconsider investing in new fossil-fired generation, and many countries are increasingly turning towards renewable energy sources to try to meet their growing electric loads.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Technology Assessment, Market Analysis and Integrated Portfolio Planning
</em></strong><strong><em>Program</em></strong> helps electric companies address these myriad interconnected issues by providing objective technical information and powerful analytic methodologies and software tools to explore familiar and emerging integrated
 resource planning issues. The program also provides a “meeting place” for company planners and fuel managers to discuss and assess technical challenges, possible solutions, and emerging information and analytical needs. This program also explores changing
 customer behavior related to the deployment of renewable energy and distributed resources, and how these kinds of resources are being incorporated into more traditional company generation resource planning efforts. This program has an extensive record of success
 providing technology cost and performance data, key information and tools to assist power companies in the electric resource planning process, and cost estimating and engineering design of new generation and retrofit projects. More specifically, the program
 provides the following:</p>

 performing screening-level financial analysis, and rapid-response support from the EPRI team, this information provides a sound basis for understanding and comparing technology cost estimates and validating results of more-detailed, engineering studies. The
 data included in the TAG<sup>®</sup> also provides key input data that companies need to conduct integrated generation portfolio planning.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong><em>Clear assessments of fuel and electricity market trends and interactions</em>
<em>.</em> </strong>Natural gas prices are a key driver of electricity prices in many markets, and fundamentally affect the economics of capital investments. At the same time, power industry demand for natural gas is an important agent of change in fuel prices
 and fuel market dynamics. EPRI research on industry trends and the near-term and long-term prospects for fuel markets provides key insights and understanding to complement projections from other sources.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong><em>Improved methods for conducting integrated resource planning.&nbsp;</em>
</strong>Increasing deployment of utility-scale renewable resources and DER requires development of new analysis methods and tools to incorporate these resources effectively in company long-term electric company resource planning. In addition, dramatic changes
 in the resource mix resulting from imposition of new environmental regulations and dramatic changes in fuel prices are requiring company resource planners to develop new approaches to conducting integrated portfolio planning that encompasses electric generation,
 transmission, and distribution planning, and which includes potential impacts to long-term system reliability.&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong><em>Consistent analysis methodologies and powerful analytic tools</em>
</strong><em>:</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TAGWEB™ provides up-to-date technology costs and performance data that can be adapted to specific locations and used for asset planning and other purposes;</p>
</li><li>
<p>EPRI’s <em>Electric Generation Expansion Analysis System (EGEAS)</em> is a powerful resource planning software tool that can be used by electric companies and regional transmission organizations to conduct Integrated Resources Planning, long-term generation
 planning, production cost modeling, and to evaluate the potential impacts of environmental policies on electric capacity and generation. EGEAS also can be used to evaluate future deployment of non-dispatchable renewable power generation technologies; energy

<p>Electric company resource planning is evolving rapidly today in response to dramatic changes occurring in the electric sector in the United States and internationally. Today, company resource planners are being called on to develop more sophisticated integrated
 resource plans that span generation, transmission and distribution systems. Additionally, some jurisdictions are beginning to implement new distribution resource planning process to address growing deployment of distributed energy resources (DER), and there
 is growing interest among state PUCs and companies in conducting “integrated resources planning.”</p>
<p>Resource planners today must contend with ongoing retirements of dispatchable baseload coal and nuclear units that traditionally have provided many of the services needed to maintain system reliability. They will also need to contend with growing deployment
 of utility-scale renewable resources and “behind-the-meter” distributed generation resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems; the advent of the “smart grid” and two-way power flow across electric sector transmission and distribution networks;
 public policies and changes in the market that incentivize deployment of energy efficiency (EE) and demand response (DR) programs; the emergence of new types of grid-connected and customer-sided electricity storage systems; and, uncertainty about future electricity
 loads and the evolution of the design of wholesale power markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these changes in the electric sector, the rapid increase in domestic natural gas production in recent years and the associated sustained decline of natural gas prices have dramatically changed the merit-order dispatch of electric power plants
 in many regions of the United States. These low prices have undercut the cost of operation of existing coal plants, and combined with increased penetration of large-scale renewable generation, low gas prices have contributed to reduced dispatch of nuclear
 units and even some recent nuclear plant retirements. The price of natural gas relative to coal and other fuels used to generate electricity is a critical variable in determining the market dispatch of power generation to meet customer load, and what types
 of new power generation technologies and facilities may be built in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the ongoing deployment of large-scale, non-dispatchable renewable energy resources (i.e., wind and solar) can be expected to continue impact the market dispatch of power plants and lead to changes in the profitability of all of the power technologies
 used to meet customer load. The deployment of utility-scale renewable resources impacts the operation of existing baseload power plants, increases cycling and associated wear and tear, may lead to over-generation in some circumstances and reduced system reliability.</p>
<p>The research undertaken by this project set is designed to help company resource planners and fuel managers to better understand the dynamics of the natural gas markets and prices, and the interactions between the fuels markets and the electric power markets.&nbsp;
 In addition, this project is designed to assist members to develop future resource planning analyses that address key structural and operational changes occurring in the electric sector today, and to develop future resources plans that address electric generation,
 transmission and distribution in a more integrated way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EPRI research program on Integrated Portfolio Planning and Market Analysis addresses needs and directly supports EPRI’s Research Imperatives #3 on “Integrated Power System and Environmental Modeling Framework.”</p>
<p>This project set also provides a key forum for electric company staff to discuss the myriad challenges associated with conducting more integrated resource planning and forecasting future fuel prices, and to identify possible approaches, gain new insights,
 test existing tools and methods to assess how they address key issues, and develop new analytical methods and capabilities. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The price of natural gas relative to coal and other fuels used to generate electricity is a critical variable in determining the market dispatch of power plants to meet customer load, and what types of new power generation technologies may be deployed in
 the future.</p>
<p>In recent years, the “shale revolution” has transformed the North American natural gas and electric power industries. The marriage of hydraulic fracturing technology and horizontal drilling of unconventional shale gas “plays,” has dramatically expanded natural
 gas production and led to lower natural gas prices. The sustained decline of natural gas prices in recent years has dramatically upended wholesale power markets, impacted the profitability of existing power plants, and altered future generation investment
 plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low natural gas prices also have created new demands for natural gas in industry and transportation, a boom in infrastructure development, and a race to develop large liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals in the U.S. and Canada.&nbsp;In addition, implementation
 of the federal Clean Power Plan to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from existing fossil-fired power plants is expected to boost demand for natural gas in the power sector in the coming years.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these changes in the fuels and power markets, company fuel managers and resource planners are focused more than ever on understanding the drivers of changing natural gas supplies, demand and future natural gas prices. While low oil and
 natural gas prices have persisted for several years now, it is notoriously difficult to predict future natural gas prices, as some analysts expect abundant supplies and low prices to persist well into the future, while others believe the period of sustained
 low prices may come to an end more quickly.</p>
<p>In addition to these key changes in fuels markets, the ongoing deployment of large-scale, non-dispatchable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, can be expected to continue to impact the market dispatch of power plants and lead to changes in
 the profitability of all of the power technologies used to meet customer load. The deployment of utility-scale renewable resources impacts the operation of existing baseload power plants, increases cycling and associated wear and tear, may lead to over-generation
 in some circumstances and reduced system reliability.</p>
<p>To manage their existing power generation fleet effectively, and to plan strategically for the next round of capital investments in new facilities, it is critical for electric company fuel managers and planners to continuously improve their understanding
 of the dynamics of the natural gas markets and prices, and the interactions between fuels markets and the electric power markets.</p>

<p>Electric company resource planning is evolving rapidly today in response to dramatic changes occurring in the electric sector. These changes include increased deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) and utility-scale variable renewable resources,
 such as wind and solar; rapid changes in the cost and performance of power generation technologies; sustained low natural gas prices; the advent of the “smart grid” and two-way power flow across electric sector transmission and distribution networks; and,
 continually evolving environmental regulations, including implementation of the final Clean Power Plan to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil-fired power generation facilities. Increasingly, resource planners are being called on to develop more sophisticated
 integrated resource plans that span power generation, transmission and distribution systems. In addition, resource planners are trying to better understand and account for a variety of key issues associated with incorporating these challenges into resource
 planning.</p>
<p>In recent years, load growth has slowed, and in some cases declined, across much of the United States as a result of slow economic growth, a transforming economy, increased reliance on demand response and distributed generation. The emergence of advanced
 distributed generation, storage, and grid technologies are changing some fundamental planning questions too. Increasing consumer choice, changing consumer behavior, and growing consumer demand for new ways to obtain electric power are beginning to impact electric
 company operations, planning and finance. These factors, combined with increased public scrutiny, media coverage of power industry decisions, and the large potential impacts of possible decisions, continue to fuel a high-stakes challenge for electric generation
 planners.</p>
<p>This research project is focused on helping companies to meet these new resource planning challenges. We do this by helping members to better understand how resource planners around the country and regulators in different jurisdictions are addressing key
 areas that have long been part of “traditional” approaches to “generation planning,” as well as approaches for integrating transmission and distribution-level planning, and identify new innovations in resource planning that may help improve member planning
 activities to address current and future challenges. &nbsp;This project also is designed help members to better understand analysis methods, tools and approaches that can be used to better incorporate deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) and utility-scale
 non-dispatchable renewable resources into integrated company resource planning.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The traditional electric distribution system philosophy has been to design and maintain a system that provides the required level of reliability and resiliency in the most cost-effective manner —minimum cost for all customers. Today, distribution system
 owners need to continually improve the efficiency and reliability of the distribution system, accommodate a higher penetrations of distributed energy resources (DER), and maximize utilization of existing distribution assets without compromising safety and
 established operating constraints.</p>
<p>Significant changes to distribution design and operating practices are needed to accommodate these new requirements. At the same time, utilities will continue to grapple with the ongoing challenges of an aging infrastructure, increasing customer expectations,
 increasing competition for resources, and an aging workforce. Recent experience with major storm events has also revealed a need to re-examine practices for designing, maintaining, and operating the distribution system to improve its overall resiliency.</p>
<p>EPRI's Distribution Systems Program has been structured to provide members with research and application knowledge to support planning and management of the grid today and the transition to a modern integrated grid. The Program delivers a portfolio of tools
 and technologies to increase overall distribution reliability and resiliency; understand the expected performance for specific components throughout its life cycle; assess methods for evaluating the condition of system components; and develop and test new
 technologies. The program delivers a blend of short-term tools such reference guides and industry practices as well as longer-term research such as component-aging characteristics and the development of new inspection technologies.&nbsp; Overall, the Program includes
 research that supports grid modernization and provides tools for planning, design, construction, maintenance, operation, and analysis of the distribution system.</p>
<p>Members of the Program gain access to a portfolio of projects that address the range of distribution issues, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with other members and EPRI technical experts to share ideas and solutions, improve knowledge transfer,
 and ultimately improve safety, reliability and operational performance.</p>

<p>Ongoing safe and reliable operation of the distribution system is in part attained through targeted inspection and maintenance of its components based on minimizing equipment life-cycle costs and risks. Many electric utilities are considering or already
 have moved toward implementing these asset management concepts.&nbsp; However, the data and analytical tools required for equipment risk assessment and management are not well established.&nbsp; Asset management decisions for maximizing performance and minimizing equipment
 life-cycle costs should be based upon risks associated with actual equipment condition and historical performance.</p>
<p>This project set provides data to asset managers to better optimize equipment selection and inspection/maintenance cycles. This is accomplished through understanding the properties of distribution components and how existing, new, and emerging inspection
 techniques may be utilized to extend component service life.</p>
<p>Information is gathered through a combination of literature reviews, field studies, interviews, equipment teardowns, and laboratory testing. Results are compiled into technical updates and guides which provide a better understanding of component reliability,
 equipment remaining life, and life-cycle cost. This project set helps utilities determine what information should be considered and how it should be prioritized to optimize cost, reliability, safety, and environmental impact.</p>

<p>Electric distribution systems are composed of immense asset fleets including poles, conductors, transformers, insulators, switchgear, and more. Many of these assets are approaching the end of or have exceeded their specified service lives. Asset managers
 must strategically allocate budget dollars to inspect/repair, replace, and/or defer maintenance. Optimized deployment of utility resources requires thorough understanding each component’s lifecycle: expected function and tolerances, costs of installation and
 upkeep, estimated service life, symptoms of degradation, and consequences of failure.</p>
<p>In 2017, this project will investigate underground switches, beginning with material and design analysis of new units purchased through the project and aged/failed units donated by utilities. Findings from aged and failed units will be used, along with existing
 industry standards, to inform procurement specifications to reduce likelihood of failure.</p>

<p>Maximum asset service life is often accomplished through appropriate inspection and maintenance of components through its service life.&nbsp; This can be costly and time consuming, so optimizing interval frequency and procedures are desirable. Additionally, decision
 support analytics and methodologies to support fleet asset management programs require new knowledge, tools and methodologies.&nbsp; There are many inspection and maintenance options available, with new technologies and products emerging. Evaluation of devices
 and process efficacy can help utilities determine where to spend their money.</p>
<p>Periodic inspection of distribution circuits provides insight regarding physical asset and overall system health. Identification of poorly performing components prior to failure avoids outages and potential safety hazards. Traditional inspection and maintenance
 practices identify some failing units, but miss some components near end-of-life, or are difficult to apply to the entire system in an appropriate amount of time at a reasonable price. Advanced inspection methods require significant investment in training
 and equipment, but can provide large returns if applied strategically and competently.</p>
<p>This project investigates existing and novel methods to obtain, process and assess asset health information. Complementing project 180.003 which correlates asset health with potential inspection data sources, this project examines the approaches and tools
 necessary to enable the utility to obtain the data needed for condition assessment decisions. Additional sources of data from SCADA and emerging “Internet of Things” technology are also considered.</p>

<p>Downed conductors and high-impedance faults remain a public safety issue for utilities, despite much research on this topic. Every year people are killed by contact to downed conductors. Existing relaying and controls on distribution systems are not able
 to detect these situations because the impedance of the faults is high, so utilities currently rely on phone calls from the public to identify these situations. New technologies and utility communications and automation infrastructure may allow for reliable
 detection of these high-impedance faults.</p>
<p>New relays within the industry have optional algorithms for detection of high-impedance faults. These algorithms have not been extensively tested and documented in the field. Utilities are adding more distribution instrumentation for metering, automation,
 and for volt-var control. This communications and metering infrastructure might also be used to detect high-impedance faults. The key research question is: can these technologies reliably detect high-impedance faults without excessive false positives.</p>

<p>Distribution automation technologies enable electric utilities to remotely monitor, coordinate, and operate intelligent distribution components in real time from remote locations. This project set evaluates and assesses distribution automation technologies
 such as sensors, switching devices, and other intelligent components that are being integrated into the system. The rigorous and unbiased evaluation and assessment methodology used in this project set includes laboratory-specified testing combined with practical
 field experience to produce fact-based results.</p>
<p>This project set will provide members with new technological developments applicable to distribution systems. This will be done by researching available options and performing fundamental research to develop new distribution technologies, such as distribution
 sensors. These projects will be multi-year efforts to scope, design, prototype, test, validate, and commercialize new distribution technologies. The developed solutions can then be used to improve distribution system reliability, safety, and asset management.</p>
<p>The work being done in this project set is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the sensor research being done in the Transmission and Substation area, and to the extent where communication technologies are involved, the Information and Communication
 Technology (P161) Program. The work is also closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work being done in the Asset Inspection, Maintenance, and Planning (P180B) Program.</p>

<p>In past years, this project has focused in line worker practices.&nbsp; For 2017, the project will be focused on an area of particular industry need, the management of distribution automation devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; These devices, used to remotely monitor, coordinate, and
 operate intelligent distribution devices and equipment in real time from remote locations, are prevalent and growing in number exponentially on distribution systems. Managing these devices (including activities such as designing, provisioning, installing and
 commissioning, testing, maintaining, operating and troubleshooting), is often challenging because it often involves coordination of resources with varied skill sets, and because of the rapid change in the technology.&nbsp; Given these challenges and the criticality
 of these devices, there is a need to identify and document leading practices for managing these devices.&nbsp; Ultimately, to move towards a “plug and play” environment, the industry needs to establish interoperability standards so that the various technologies
 necessary for these devices integrate properly.</p>

 and emerging industry challenges and solutions.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Customers are growing more and more sophisticated, with increasing expectations of value, speed, and reliability based on service interactions in multiple business sectors, such as home entertainment, business computing and communications, and the Internet
 of Things. These expectations are carrying over to the electricity sector. At the same time, customers are beginning to consider options related to electricity supply and use, with choices often coming from third parties, not their utility. Technology advances
 are giving customers more choice and control over when and how they use electricity, including smart appliances and thermostats, plug-in electric vehicles, and options for local generation, such as rooftop solar photovoltaics. The choices customers make are
 already having recognizable impacts on the electricity system, particularly on energy consumption and load shapes, and these impacts will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Customer choice and control can enhance the value of electricity service to the individual customer and to customers as a whole. Because utilities have established relationships with their customers, they can be very effective change agents toward offering
 customers choices that align with both customer and utility objectives. Utilities have opportunities to meet customer expectations and to dynamically integrate customers and their choices into the power system. However, with the increasing sophistication of
 customers, new and diverse strategies to integrate customers are needed going forward. For example, utilities can learn from competitive industries’ methods for understanding their customers. Businesses have developed detailed knowledge of their customers’
 preferences and behaviors over decades of gathering information. They apply this knowledge of customer interests and values to devise products and services that meet diverse demands, and then they make appropriate offers to targeted customers. Similarly, utilities
 need strategies for creating and offering compelling choices for electricity service.</p>
<p>EPRI’s Understanding Electric Utility Customers research is focused on providing utilities with insights and tools to understand and to take action with their customers to offer choices that are aligned with customer preferences as well as utility and societal
 objectives of providing reliable, affordable, and environmentally-responsible power.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This research provides results and tools utilities can use to develop customer programs that have a greater likelihood of success in terms of customer acceptance and of customer behavior change that benefits customers and society. The costs of implementing
 ineffective programs can be avoided by participating in and using the research. The research will also help utilities use the customer participation and impacts forecasts in utility planning and operations.&nbsp; The collaborative approach provides opportunities
 to interact with diverse member organizations that have pioneered research approaches, have taken the risk to implement pilot programs, or have full customer programs in place. Collaboratively-developed tools are more cost effective and are designed based
 on larger and more diverse data sets, resulting in more robust tools that give higher value results than if developed by a single entity. Furthermore, such tools can be expanded with each new wave of research and the underlying foundations can be shared so
 that confidence in robust results among stakeholders is strong. Delving into existing programs and pilots provides a rich set of secondary research results that can often be used to estimate impacts on utility systems in place of spending the time and resources
 on primary research. With resources and results available, members have the opportunity to increase customer satisfaction by offering programs and services that customers prefer and targeting those customers that prefer them, while meeting corporate and societal
 goals.</p>
<p>This program provides insights, tools, and methods to help utilities understand and more meaningfully engage with their customers to empower them to make optimal choices with respect to their supply and use of electricity. These choices will enhance customer
 satisfaction while also aligning with the utility and societal objectives of keeping electricity service reliable, affordable, and environmentally responsible.</p>
<p>Further, this program supports one of EPRI’s Research Imperatives to “Enable Integration of Customer Resources” by providing critical information related to customer preferences for and adoption of customer resources.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This research program conducts research to forecast and understand the impacts of customer participation, performance, and persistence with respect to electricity service plans such as rate structures, coupled with enabling technologies and information and
 customer technologies such as plug-in electric vehicles and solar photovoltaic systems. The research also helps utilities create effective offerings based on what customer prefer and aligned with what will benefit society. This program will also develop strategies
 to incorporate customer impacts into system planning and operations.</p>
<p>The program focuses on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing and demonstrating methods to characterize customer preferences. </li><li>Developing and testing new approaches for understanding customer diversity and developing robust, reliable methods for building actionable customer groupings and associations.
</li><li>Synthesizing experience and knowledge of critical customer topics facing the industry that members can use for evaluating alternatives.
</li><li>Capturing case studies to document examples of utility successes; for example, use of customer data to improve utility operations and customer satisfaction.
</li><li>Identifying the process of developing and incorporating new customer programs, from conceptualization to estimating impacts on utility operations to integrating them into utility operations.
</li><li>Designing effective electricity service plans employing rate structure designs that combine conceptual guidance from the disciplines of finance and economics with real-world experience about how customers respond to different rate structures.
</li><li>Identifying strategies for integrating the impacts of behavioral programs fully into utility system planning and operations, so that utilities can effectively plan for expected changes in electricity use and load shape.
</li><li>The work being done in this program is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work undertaken in the Electric Transportation (P18), Energy Storage and Distributed Generation (P94), End-Use Energy Efficiency and Demand Response (P170), and
 Integration of Distributed Energy Resources (P174) Programs. </li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>In the three years this program has existed, EPRI has addressed the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the foundational frameworks for understanding electricity customers?
</li><li>What results can we use from the pricing and behavior pilots and programs conducted to date?
</li><li>What are appropriate methods for understanding preferences for unfamiliar offerings?
</li><li>What are methods for utilities to effectively develop and manage offerings to customers?
</li><li>What are the customer-related linkages between wholesale (e.g., regional transmission organizations) and retail (e.g., distribution utilities) entities?
</li></ul>
<p>These questions are addressed below along with key research results.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are the foundational frameworks for understanding electricity customers?</em>
</strong></p>
<p>When embarking on this program, EPRI recognized that foundational frameworks would help enhance the value and understanding of research results by members, which have been represented by advisors from diverse backgrounds and responsibilities. This foundational
 work is available for all program members for various purposes, such as to help bring new staff members into the customer research area or to educate other parts of utility organizations on the value of understanding customers. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>EPRI developed the concept of electricity service plans to describe a broader vision of customer programs than simply rate structures. EPRI envisions electricity service plans as rate structures combined with behavioral inducements such as electricity usage
 information/feedback and enabling technologies to empower customers to change their electricity use and use patterns.
</li><li>In the course of conducting secondary research, EPRI focused on what we call the 3 Ps: participation, performance, and persistence. These are the critical aspects of measuring the impacts of customer programs.
</li><li>EPRI documented a number of frameworks that guide members in their customer pursuits, for example,

<p><strong><em>What results can we use from the pricing and behavior pilots and programs conducted to date?</em>
</strong></p>
<p>EPRI established a foundation for addressing the most critical gaps in its synthesis of research findings (EPRI 1023562:
<em>Understanding Electric Utility Customers</em>) and has subsequently developed a significant library of secondary research in several reports and also in presentations delivered to members via Webcast, including:</p>
<ul>

</li></ul>
<p>Transparency and research rigor are bolstered by EPRI making research findings available to a wider research audience—a practice not typically followed in the industry.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are appropriate methods for understanding preferences for unfamiliar offerings?</em>
</strong></p>
<p>EPRI researched methods for estimating preferences for residential customers, particularly for unfamiliar offerings, which is typical of utility pricing programs (EPRI
<a href=""http://www.epri.com/abstracts/Pages/ProductAbstract.aspx?ProductId=000000000001024401"" target=""_blank"">
1024401</a>: <em>Methods for Characterizing Customer Preferences for Electric Service Plans</em>). EPRI found that discrete choice experimentation, an approach used for product development in competitive markets, can also work in regulated markets for hypothetical
 or unfamiliar offerings.</p>
<p>EPRI tested discrete choice experimentation for time of use and fixed bill preferences for utility members in diverse regions with residential customers. The results show that between 20 and 30 percent of residential customers state that they would select
 a time of use rate. The project demonstrated how effective this approach is. EPRI is now working with utilities to document the findings and expand the types of electricity service plans the models can infer for the population.&nbsp; In 2015, EPRI developed a software
 tool, Customer Preferences Estimator, to help utilities estimate the market share of various time-of-use rate and fixed bill designs, using the results from the supplemental project
<em>Characterizing Residential Customer Preferences for Electricity Service Plans.</em></p>
<p>IN 2016, EPRI embarked on a similar study on methods to estimate preferences for commercial customers.</p>
<p>Program 182 worked jointly with the Electric Transportation (Program 18) to characterize preferences for electric vehicles:</p>

</li></ul>
<p><strong><em>What are methods for utilities to effectively develop and manage offerings to customers?</em>
</strong></p>
<p>EPRI developed and demonstrated a method for developing electricity service plan offerings that align with utility strategic goals, which was demonstrated with utility members. This work pulls together secondary and primary research on customer preferences
 with the understanding of the financial impacts of customer participation in electricity service plans. EPRI’s detailed pricing model estimates the changes in revenues resulting from electricity service plan participation.</p>
<p>In addition, EPRI developed an electricity service plan portfolio management system that can help a utility manage a portfolio of electricity service plans that together meet utility strategic goals.</p>

</li></ul>
<p><strong><em>What are the customer-related linkages between wholesale (e.g., regional transmission organizations) and retail (e.g., distribution utilities) entities?</em>
</strong></p>
<p>EPRI developed a conceptual framework for understanding the role and value of demand response in determining what level of service reliability to provide customers. It will help program designers understand the underlying market mechanisms that determine
 why and to what extent consumers are willing to participate in load curtailment programs designed to reduce capacity costs, and how their participation affects capacity costs.</p>

<p>The 2016 program continues to tap into the body of research and results to conduct practical and critical reviews of current challenges, trends, and opportunities. Members select the topics and receive the results in webcast form for easy sharing among colleagues
 and stakeholders. Study of data analytics to benefit customers continues with the development of functional requirements for data analytics capability within a utility. Commercial customers are the focus of the preferences research in 2016.&nbsp; Selecting appropriate
 research methods for estimating preferences for commercial customers is the first step.&nbsp; Following that step, a field study to determine preferences will be launched.&nbsp; Finally, we delve into working across the utility to help the planning and operations teams
 incorporate customer participation and impacts estimates into their work. This will open up lines of communications and help to improve the planning and raise awareness of customer choices and their impacts on electricity use.</p>

<p>In the quickly changing utility environment, there is more opportunity than ever to deliver new products and services that help utilities&nbsp; both engage with their customers more productively, as well as employ them as grid resources.&nbsp; But what do customers
 want?&nbsp; And how can utilities rely on customer program impacts for planning purposes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>These questions represent very broad research areas, and this project seeks to contribute to their resolution by carving out specific topical research questions that P182 members ask us to investigate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Past research topics have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utility procedures for bringing new offerings to customers </li><li>Residential demand/partial usage charges: rate structures to accommodate distributed generation
</li><li>Bring your own device programs: what are they, what do they mean for customers, and how do demand impacts differ compared to traditional utility programs?
</li></ul>
<p>Potential topics for 2017 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>On talking to people: communications experts on educating customers about complicated utility concepts
</li><li>Behavioral programs and opportunities for low income customers: prepay, bill alerts, and beyond
</li><li>Residential demand charges II: experiences from recent pilots and implementations

<p>As utilities continue AMI and other smart grid investments, and as customer interest in connected devices grows, so do the myriad of data streams that these technologies make available. Other industries claim that using advanced customer data analytics of
 “Big Data” has led to a better understanding of customer needs, more efficient processes, and new and more targeted service offerings. The utility industry is now in the early stages of learning how to make use of its customer data to obtain similar ends,
 and in ways that show tangible value. At the same time, the proliferation of data analytics platforms on the market, and the value they may deliver, is difficult to get a handle on.</p>
<p>This project seeks to address the primary research question of “How can utilities make use of their customer data, in conjunction with other data sources, to maximum its value for both customers and the utility?” by focusing on two specific objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look within the utility industry for novel data analytics applications. </li><li>Look to other industries that make use of advanced customer analytics to understand their applications, how they use findings to maximize value, the systems and personnel they have in place, and how they justified those investments initially.

<p>Commercial (business) customers, those with loads under 500 kW, typically have few alternatives to a standard, one-size-fits-all electric service. Business use electricity in a variety of spatially and temporally different ways that provide opportunities
 for them to benefit from service diversification. A wide range of pricing plans, more aligned with marginal electricity supply costs can leverage those opportunities and provide benefits to all customers, not just those that subscribe to them.</p>
<p>Utilities and other service providers must be able to predict participation in prospective services to determine if offing them is worthwhile, and if so in what manner. The market potential may be limited and specific to certain customers, so effective implementation
 requires further differentiation: who are the likely subscribers? Specific to the utility industry, effective system planning and operation depends on a solid understanding of how customer's preferences for prospective services will impact system resources.
 &nbsp;Until market research methods that meet these needs are devised and proven, commercial customer will be underserved to the detriment of all consumers of electricity and electric system operation. Additionally, offering choices (a portfolio) requires that
 those serve are internally consistent (the reflect real differences on costs) and externally viable (they produce sufficient revenues to over those costs).</p>

<p>Utilities must anticipate and be responsive to the expanding choices available to consumers in how they purchase electricity. Those choices include diverse forms of price response, ranging from paying prices that are posted a day ahead, or even a few minutes
 ahead, to purchasing fully hedged service for several years, to being paid occasionally to forego electricity usage. They also include a variety of ways to become a producer of some of their electric requirements: directly by installing distributed generation,
 effectively through on-site storage devices, or virtually through cooperative agreements that include either or both. Offering classes of customers a single way to buy electricity is neither sustainable nor desirable for utilities.</p>
<p>Consumer choices produce fundamental changes in electric demand. These need to be recognized, characterized, and quantified because they have profound consequences for how utilities plan and operate their electric system. This involves more than increasingly
 sophisticated load forecasts. It requires developing planning protocols that take into account how changes in electricity demand effect the requirements to deliver diverse services reliably. It requires extending those learnings to system operations so that
 the benefits of diversified demand are realized, and adverse outcomes are anticipated and averted. In other words, it requires utilities to evolve from operating as a collection of separate functional units to a cohesive enterprise which shares information
 and focuses on customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continue to provide reliable, safe and affordable power, the utility of the future must incorporate customer behavior into utility strategic, tactical, and operational activities. This involves both functional realignment and cultural adjustments. To
 make these necessary changes, the utility must coordinate customer research with enterprise planning and operations so that they share a common goal, develop ways to collaborate on research initiatives, define common data needs, and take joint responsibility
 for achievement of goals. This can happen organically in a collaborative technical and business environment that is focused on customers’ wants and needs, and fulfilling them responsibly and effectively. Therefore, integrating enterprise activity around a
 customer focus makes the requisite cultural changes inevitable.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>A better awareness of industry and government collaborative efforts, where members can &quot;plug in&quot; to current activities;
</li><li>Guidance on developing cyber security strategies and requirements for selecting effective technologies;
</li><li>Guidance on security metrics; </li><li>Techniques for assessing and monitoring risk; </li><li>Practical approaches to mitigating the risk of operating legacy systems; </li><li>Early identification of security gaps through laboratory assessments of security technologies; and
</li><li>Technologies which support the management of cyber incidents and increase the cyber security and resiliency of the grid.
</li></ul>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The portfolio of projects in the Cyber Security and Privacy Program has delivered several key accomplishments that have helped its members specifically and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>National Electric Sector Cybersecurity Organization Resource (NESCOR)</strong>: National Electric Sector Cybersecurity Organization Resource (NESCOR): The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded EPRI a contract to provide research and development
 resources for DOE’s public-private partnership, NESCOR. EPRI led the working groups that focus on identifying vulnerabilities and threats, assessing cyber security standards, and testing and validating technologies. The results of this work have been used
 to develop improved threat models, cyber security requirements, and security technologies. NESCOR delivered the following documents: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Electric Sector Failure Scenarios and Impact Analyses</em> </strong>
<strong>:</strong> This document includes cyber security failure scenarios and impact analyses for the electric sector. A cyber security failure scenario is a realistic event in which the failure to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of
 sector cyber assets creates a negative impact on the generation, transmission, and/or delivery of power.
</li><li><strong><em>Analysis of Selected Electric Sector High Risk Failure Scenarios</em>
</strong><strong>: </strong>The failure scenarios in this document provide detailed analyses for a subset of the failure scenarios identified in the document listed above, which were prioritized for inclusion in this document, based upon the level of risk for
 the failure scenario and the priorities of NESCOR utility members. </li><li><strong><em>Attack Trees for Selected Electric Sector High Risk Failure Scenarios</em>
</strong><strong>:</strong> This briefing includes the modified attack tree diagrams from the detailed analysis documents.
</li><li><strong><em>Guide to Penetration Testing for Electric Utilities</em> </strong>
<strong>:</strong> This security test plan provides guidance to electric utilities on how to perform penetration tests in the smart grid domains of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), demand response (DR), distributed energy resources (DER), distribution
 grid management (DGM), electric transportation (ET), and wide-area monitoring, protection, and control (WAMPAC). Penetration testing is one of the many different types of assessments that utilities can perform to evaluate their overall security posture.
</li><li><strong><em>Guidelines for Leveraging NESCOR Failure Scenarios in Cyber Security Tabletop Exercises:</em>&nbsp;</strong>This document provides exercise facilitators with guidance concerning procedures and responsibilities for exercise development, facilitation,
 simulation, and support. It also includes a NESCOR failure scenario and explains how to expand this scenario for use in a cyber security tabletop exercise.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Incident and Threat Management: </strong>Within the Security Technologies Project Set, EPRI is addressing the challenge of managing cyber and physical threats to substation and field devices.&nbsp; In 2016, EPRI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed and tested use cases for real world situations correlating aggregated data from substation sources in the Cyber Security Research Lab (CSRL);
</li><li>Identified incident detection architectures for the Integrated Security Operations Center (ISOC) field devices and developed a corresponding test bed in the CSRL; and
</li><li>Specified the requirements and tasks necessary to integrate the incident detections systems with SIEM tools.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Assessing and Monitoring Risk:</strong> Within the Information Assurance Project Set, EPRI focuses on security challenges that affect multiple operations domains, such as designing security into products, creating security metrics for the electric

<p>For grid modernization, increased interconnection in electric sector devices is required and this will result in a larger attack surface that may be exploited by potential adversaries such as nation-states, terrorist organizations, malicious contractors,
 and disgruntled employees. A security architecture methodology that is used for attack vector analysis needs to be developed to support cyber security risk management in this new environment.</p>
<p>The objective is to provide a common methodology that may be used by utilities of all sizes – from large investor owned utilities (IOUs) to smaller cooperatives and municipalities. EPRI is collaborating with other research efforts that are defining enterprise
 architecture methodologies to ensure that the security architecture methodology does not conflict with these other efforts.</p>

<p>Cyber security standards, guidance, and regulations have been developed as a result of continual threats to business and process control networks. In recent years, electric utilities that are part of the North American bulk electric system (BES) have established
 cyber security programs to ensure compliance with the critical infrastructure protection (CIP) standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).&nbsp;New cyber security requirements for critical infrastructure are being introduced in other
 regions as well, such as the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive of the European Commission. In addition, some states are developing cyber security requirements for the distribution sector of the grid.</p>
<p>Compliance with cyber security regulations and cyber security requirements is non-trivial and requires IT staff and control system engineers to work together to implement and maintain a cyber security program for control systems.</p>
<p>This research project is mapped to the following C2 M2 domains: Risk Management (RM), Asset, Change and Configuration Management (ACM), Identity and Access Management (IAM), Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM), and Cyber Security Program Management
 (CPM). Note: compliance is referenced in all of the C2M2 domains, but this project focuses on the ones listed above.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the electric sector has produced both mandatory and voluntary standards and guidelines to address cyber security. Each of these attempts to enhance the security posture of a utility, despite the fact that each utility has unique environments,
 ownership structures, and functions for the overall reliability of the nation’s power grid. These standards and guidelines were developed in similar ways to the sector’s creation of documents in other fields—balancing of load and generation, management of
 reliability events, and other functions required for reliable operations. The science and engineering behind power systems dates back to the late 1800s, with thousands of studies and measurement behind each model used for planning and operations. Unfortunately,
 cyber security is not as mature—as a field, the science involved in protecting digital systems has only existed for a fraction of the history shared with power systems engineering. Over the past two decades, research has continued to evolve in the field of
 cyber security measurement. These advancements make it possible to implement a cyber security metrics program within any utility, regardless of size, organization, or ownership structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several challenges with cyber security metrics. While there are many business and regulatory pressures driving utilities to improve process efficiency, there is also a lack of data sharing required to have a dialogue regarding “what metrics matter”
 in cyber security. As a result, security metrics routinely focus on standards development or other frameworks that may not be entirely appropriate for measurement.</p>
<p>This research project is mapped to the following C2M2 domain: Risk Management (RM). (Note: metrics is not specifically referenced in the C2M2, but is used as part of risk management.)</p>

<p>Commercially available information and communications technology (ICT) solutions present significant benefits including low cost, interoperability, and choice among competing vendors. These commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions can be proprietary or
 open source and can meet the needs of a global base of customers. However, the same globalization and other factors that allow for such benefits also increase the risk of a threat event which can impact the ICT supply chain. These ICT supply chain risks may
 include insertion of malicious software and hardware.</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Demands to supply water to a growing population are increasing worldwide and having profound impacts on the use of limited water resources. The electric power industry requires large water quantities and is frequently subject to water shortages. It also
 discharges water that is no longer usable within the power plant, and needs to be able to comply with the steam electric power generating industry standards and regulations. Nations and regions worldwide are adopting regulations on discharge limits and improving
 water utilization for electricity generation. The adoption of new water-conserving technologies for power production can help alleviate pressures to reduce water withdrawals, consumption and discharges, while maintaining power plants’ abilities to meet demand
 for electricity.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI's) Water Management Technology program (Program 185) identifies, evaluates, and demonstrates cost-effective and reliable treatment technologies that support limiting pollutants discharged from a power plant.
 The program also evaluates the performance, operability, reliability, and cost of advanced cooling technologies designed to reduce water withdrawal and consumption while minimizing the impact on plant thermal efficiency. These technologies are applicable worldwide
 and equally to Rankine steam boiler and gas-fired combined-cycle units. To reduce water consumption, the program evaluates processes to recover moisture from the flue gas (Rankine or combined-cycle) and to enable re-use of wastewater streams within the power
 plant by removing species that cause scaling and/or corrosion.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Program research helps facility owners develop effective water treatment compliance and water conservation strategies. As water discharge limits are becoming more stringent for selenium, mercury, arsenic, other trace metals and nutrients (nitrates/nitrites)
 tighten, power companies require independent performance and economic data on cost-effective, reliable treatment options. Where such technologies are not available or cost-effective, the program seeks and evaluates new processes that could meet the target
 discharge concentrations.</p>
<p>Program research also provides power companies with performance, thermal penalty, and cost data on cooling options that reduce or avoid the withdrawal and/or consumption of water. In-depth evaluations of currently-available approaches enable power companies
 to evaluate their near-term options with greater confidence. Identification, development, and evaluation of novel technologies (mostly found under EPRI’s Technology Innovation Program and transferred to this program after feasibility has been shown) can help
 power generators reduce their water withdrawal/consumption with less impact on plant thermal efficiency. Complementary work to demonstrate the benefits of water balance modeling, and the capabilities of water treatment technologies to render wastewater streams
 usable in plant processes, can enable power plant operators to reduce demand for fresh water.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>EPRI seeks new wastewater treatment and conservation technologies that can support reduced pollutant discharge concentrations or reduce water consumption. Program 185 guides further development of technologies and provides independent performance, thermal
 efficiency, and cost evaluations. For wastewater treatment processes, the program generally uses the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for appropriate technologies (existing or emerging) </li><li>Screen promising processes via laboratory bench tests (e.g., “jar tests”) </li><li>Demonstrate proof-of-concept in pilot units treating actual wastewaters </li></ul>
<p>The program follows a similar approach for water conservation and advanced cooling technologies. The program also utilizes the Water Research Center, located at Georgia Power’s Plant Bowen, to support proof-of-concept pilot tests and, possibly, near-commercial-scale
 system studies.</p>
<p>Program results are communicated through updates to members, reports, and educational briefings for policy makers and regulators. This program delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent evaluations of wastewater treatment systems, including overall treatment performance and capital as well as operation and maintenance costs. Systems include physical/chemical, biological, and zero liquid discharge (ZLD).
</li><li>Evaluations of cooling technologies that can reduce water withdrawal/consumption (especially fresh water) significantly, with much less degradation of plant thermal performance and fewer operations/maintenance issues than currently available options, such
 as air-cooled condensers. Many of these technologies can be used worldwide and on either boiler-based Rankine or gas-fired combined-cycle units.
</li><li>Assessments of the ability to re-use wastewaters within the power plant, after appropriate treatment, and associated performance and cost projections.
</li><li>Experiences in using a variety of water balance modeling tools to minimize overall fresh water consumption and pollutant discharge.
</li><li>A database of emerging water treatment or conservation/reuse technologies of potential applicability to the power industry worldwide, to be used by EPRI for R&amp;D planning and informing the industry of improved treatment options.
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Since this program’s inception in 2013, critical research has addressed plant water balance models, advanced cooling technology evaluations, and water treatment developments. Focus on hybrid cooling has resulted in two demonstration projects at the Water
 Research Center. In the area of water treatment, besides several technology developments centered on flue gas desulfurization (FGD), additional projects involving membrane techniques and innovative thermal evaporation have shown promise in highly concentrated
 wastewater streams, which indicates they could be applied to many potentially difficult-to-treat chemistry applications.</p>
<p>Many of the research activities in Program 185 will enhance the core deliverables of treatment guidelines and a five-year rotating plan of open and closed cooling water chemistry guidelines, followed by guidelines for physical chemical FGD wastewater optimization,
 biological treatment processes, and thermal evaporation and other ZLD approaches.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Program R&amp;D for 2017 will address the treatment of selenium, mercury, arsenic, and nutrients in FGD blowdown as well as other constituents of interest such as boron and bromide. The program also will address methods of managing cooling tower water chemistry
 to reduce water consumption through increased cycles of concentration; options for biofouling control in cooling systems; moisture recovery from flue gas; and treatment systems to enable use of degraded waters for plant cooling. Specifically, the research
 will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek novel water management technologies that improve pollutant removal and/or water conservation.
</li><li>Develop biological treatment guidelines and physical/chemical wet FGD wastewater treatment guidelines for optimized performance.
</li><li>Find, assess, and test promising technologies that cost-effectively remove trace metals including selenium, mercury, and arsenic; nutrients, and soluble species (e.g., boron and bromine) from power plant wastewaters. The emphasis will include both innovative
 physical/chemical and biological treatment processes and concerns with scaling and fouling of associated membrane filtration devices.
</li><li>Discover and determine the effectiveness of scaling and deposition monitoring techniques that allow corrective action to be taken before a problem occurs. This will be supplemented with a software tool for identifying and mitigating formation of deposits.
</li><li>Develop cooling water treatment guidelines that address challenges of biofouling while preserving environmental compliance with current and potential future regulations.
</li><li>Prepare treatment and design consideration guidelines for the use of degraded water supplies, such as municipal wastewater or high salinity/brackish water that could be alternative water sources for freshwater power plant make-up.
</li><li>Identify potential processes to recover water from evaporative plant losses or water vapor content in flue gas streams and test their effectiveness and durability.
</li><li>Conduct evaluations of wastewater byproduct encapsulation applications, including at power plants where coal combustion byproducts are combined with water/wastewater and other materials for landfill application.
</li><li>Identify and determine the feasibility of innovative approaches to remove scaling and corrosive compounds from wastewaters to allow their reuse in the power plant.

<p>As water scarcity increases around the world it is critical that electric utilities find new ways to consume less fresh water from local sources. This can be accomplished more immediately by water optimization within the plant, wastewater treatment including
 increasing reuse and technological innovation to reduce fresh water consumption. A concurrent path would also be to pursue desalination to provide water for use within the plant and/or to supplement fresh water to the local community. Power plants are a natural
 partner for desalination, which is a very energy intensive process, and cogeneration of fresh water and power at utilities in water scarce regions has been successfully demonstrated internationally.&nbsp; The many water treatment systems existing in this scenario
 are usually evaluated as stand-alone technologies of either thermal evaporation or membrane treatment processes, depending on water chemistry and volume.&nbsp; Combinations of these technologies can reduce the size of costly thermal systems by reducing feed volume
 with less costly membrane systems prior to subsequent thermal evaporation.&nbsp; This project will address the advantages and disadvantages of potential combinations of desalination and wastewater treatment practices providing a selection guide to when and how
 a combination treatment strategy would be beneficial.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Renewable energy is fundamentally changing the electricity industry's strategic landscape. Active industry engagement in development and deployment of renewable energy for power generation has increased significantly, and continued engagement is more critical
 than ever before. Renewable portfolio standards, financial incentives, concerns over energy security, desire for a diversified generation portfolio, continually declining capital costs, and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will continue to drive
 renewable energy deployment.</p>
<p>Over the long term, renewable energy development will depend on renewables operating cost-effectively without mandates or subsidies. Research and development can improve the efficiency of various technologies in converting renewable energy resources to electricity.
 Improved operations and maintenance practices and technologies can reduce costs associated with utility-scale operations of renewable power plants. Up-to-date information is critical to explore new opportunities for deployment, operation, and maintenance of
 renewable generation. Finally, targeted research is necessary to reduce the cost of renewable generation, improve overall reliability, and facilitate widespread deployment.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s Renewable Generation program (Program 193) provides a portfolio of research and development opportunities that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assesses the status, performance, and cost of renewable generating technologies, including wind, solar, hydro, biomass, and geothermal;
</li><li>Conducts targeted research and development to address critical issues relative to the technical assessment, operation, maintenance, and overall reliability of renewable generation resources;
</li><li>Evaluates the technical and economic impacts of emerging renewable energy technology and&nbsp;O&amp;M&nbsp;trends; and
</li><li>Provides opportunities for members to engage in general-interest renewable generation activities, including workshops, tours, and other events.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Renewable energy resources and their application in generating electricity most often are considered collectively when addressing key drivers in renewable energy deployment, including renewable portfolio standards, energy security, greenhouse gas emission
 reductions, and other issues. However, wind, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, biomass, geothermal energy and hydropower options largely are unrelated technologically; each has its own developmental status, readiness timeline, industry drivers, and economic
 and technology challenges. EPRI's Renewable Generation program conducts targeted research to improve the performance, availability, and cost-effectiveness of existing renewable technologies and to develop new renewable technologies and applications. The program
 also provides objective cost and performance information for renewable technologies, helping participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalize on market opportunities for renewable compliance and power purchases, resulting in improved decision-making;
</li><li>Identify the appropriate role of diverse renewable resources in expanding new and sustainable generation capacity; and
</li><li>Apply results from modeling, simulation, and future energy scenario analyses that will help guide decisions on renewable energy assets.
</li></ul>
<p>Through collaboration with key industry stakeholders, EPRI members guide development and demonstration of technologies that will optimize operating efficiency, reduce overall costs, and improve reliability of large-scale renewable generation.</p>
<p>In the face of increasing renewable generation penetration, EPRI’s Renewables Program provides current information on key renewable generation technologies, including technical performance and system costs.&nbsp; The work undertaken enables power producers to
 most effectivity integrate renewables into their generation fleet and tackle the unique issues associated with renewable asset management.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Value is delivered to members of Program 193 in a variety of ways:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>EPRI keeps members informed about global technical developments through advisory meetings, webcasts, and networking to share experiences and capitalize on the lessons learned by others.
</li><li>Participants are able to identify and prioritize research needs and engage in technology-specific research and development projects that focus on specific areas of interest. Participants benefit from the collaborative development of solutions to common
 technology challenges that they could not afford to solve individually. </li><li>Through collaboration with technical experts across EPRI (e.g., operations and maintenance, nondestructive evaluation, renewable integration, energy storage, and energy and environmental analysis activities), Program 193 helps members learn about the latest
 technologies to improve energy recovery from renewable resources, understand the role of these energy resources, and helps develop and implement a robust research portfolio to address identified critical technology issues.
</li><li>Transfer of technology to participants is achieved through technical reports and guidelines, participation in technology development activities, pilot-scale demonstrations and testing programs, technology applications at participant asset locations, technology
 interest groups and topical workshops, and engagement with key industry stakeholders and the general public.
</li></ul>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Accomplishments</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<ul>
<li>Modeling, data mining of cost information from completed projects, and financial analyses efforts have provided insights on renewable generation costs (capital and production) and technology trends that directly support integrated resource planning activities
 and future generation scenario analyses. Products include economic and energy scenario analyses, topical reports on renewable technology issues, and webcasts/meetings of strategic interest to members and key stakeholders. Recent topical analyses included conduit
 hydro technologies, biomass combined heat and power, and community solar. </li><li>EPRI activities at the Solar Technology Acceleration Center (SolarTAC) have expanded EPRI’s research capabilities to include reliability and performance testing in a real-world environment. Results address issues around site requirements, installation,
 commissioning, performance, reliability, and O&amp;M for multiple solar technologies.
</li><li>EPRI activities at the Southeastern Solar Research Center are providing valuable insights into solar photovoltaic performance in a variety of installation configurations in a humid environment, including short-term solar forecasting and long-term performance
 and reliability through accelerated aging. </li><li>Program 193 R&amp;D has led to development of best practices and guidelines for wind turbine maintenance and performance optimization, including cost-effective nondestructive examination of wind turbine blades while in operation, best practices for managing
 wind farm end-of-warranty concerns, and maintenance guidelines. </li><li>EPRI activities in hydropower led to development and demonstration of a robotic inspection technology to cost-effectively inspect the surface and near-surface (i.e., subsurface) regions of hydro civil structures.&nbsp;This work is now being expanded to improve
 underwater inspection capabilities and enhance penstock integrity assessment. </li><li>General-interest activities in renewable generation technologies, including industry meetings, technical tours, and technology summits/workshops, provide valuable overviews of critical technology issues and identify future research needs.

<p>Renewable generation is fundamentally changing the electricity industry's strategic landscape. Active industry engagement in development and deployment of renewable energy for power generation has increased significantly, and continued engagement is more
 critical than ever before. Renewable portfolio standards, financial incentives, concerns over energy security, consistent reductions in capital and operating costs, improvements in performance measures, and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will continue
 to drive renewable energy deployment.&nbsp; Information is critical to exploring new opportunities for deployment, operation, and maintenance of renewable generation. Effective resource planning and new generation development requires accurate cost and performance
 information for commercial renewable technologies.&nbsp; It is equally important that utility staff understand the renewable generation market and how technology, costs and performances of renewable generation will trend over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Set 193A is the comprehensive, integrative program responsible for providing members with current and projected costs – capital, O&amp;M, and levelized cost of electricity and technology advancements for renewable generation sources.&nbsp; The program is
 considered a particular helpful resource that supports generation planning and project development.&nbsp; The research in this project set is driven by&nbsp;utilities' needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess the status, performance, and cost of renewable generating technologies
</li><li>Address critical issues relative to the economics of renewable generation resources
</li><li>Assist and guide investments in renewable energy and support long-term generation planning efforts
</li></ul>
<p>Each renewable-resource specific technical report provides an overview of&nbsp;generation options including technology descriptions, performance characteristics, and near-term, emerging technology advancements that have the potential to positively impact the
 costs.&nbsp; In addition, detailed&nbsp;capital and O&amp;M costs are developed based on current market conditions and projected trends.&nbsp; Costs are benchmarked against other sources with a great degree of effort on transparency in explaining variances.&nbsp; LCOE estimates are
 estimated, along with probabilistic&nbsp;modeling to&nbsp;provide a comprehensive&nbsp;financial analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>All utilities face the question of exactly where renewable generation will fit in the future of low-carbon electricity generation. According to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data from March 2016, non-hydro renewables generated more than 10%
 of the U.S. electricity for the first time. There is a significant level of business and technical uncertainty as to which emerging renewable technologies will be most cost-effective, reliable, and durable in the long run. Utilities need a clear understanding
 of the opportunities and risks associated with renewable generation technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While wind energy continues to hold a larger share of power generation, solar energy is experiencing record-setting growth. The installed cumulative solar&nbsp;capacity at the end of 2015 was 247 GW, a growth of approximately 30% over the installed solar capacity
 in 2015.&nbsp;Double-digit expansion is expected to continue in the near term, primarily with solar photovoltaics (PV). However, concentrating solar power (CSP) installations are expected to increase, particularly in international markets. As utility planners and
 others involved in generation portfolio decisions consider making new or expanded investments in solar&nbsp;power, they need accurate technical information to support their choices.</p>

<p>All utilities face the question of exactly where renewable generation will fit in their future low-carbon and diversified choices for electricity generation. There is a significant level of business and technical uncertainty as to which emerging renewable
 technologies will be most cost-effective, reliable, and durable in the long run. Utilities need a clearer understanding of the opportunities and risks of relying on renewable generation and how this likely will affect the bottom line. It is increasingly important
 for energy providers and the public to have the best available information about cost and performance of renewable generation options for use in corporate planning and strategy.</p>
<p>As renewable energy penetration grows, storage technologies are increasingly becoming more important for grid stability and reducing capacity variability.&nbsp; While much of the attention around storage has focused on batteries, specifically Li-ion batteries,
 there is a growing interest in pumped storage hydropower.&nbsp; This technology is commercial; however, it has been limited due to either a lack of appropriate sites, capital intensity of projects or environmental concerns.&nbsp; Closed-loop pumped storage, hydropower
 projects that are not continuously connected to naturally flowing water feature, have the potential of being an alternative that can be implemented with little impact to the environment and potentially less expensive than traditional open-looped pumped storage
 projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Access to up-to-date information on technology innovation and potential, as well as targeted research and large-scale demonstrations, are necessary to reduce capital and operating costs, minimize environmental impacts, and increase reliability, improving
 the attractiveness of future wind energy deployment. Objective assessments are needed of the status, the technical and economic feasibility, and the requirements for further development and demonstration of new wind turbines and components of emerging technologies.
 The needed R&amp;D scope includes blades, rotors, drive trains, gearboxes, generators and power electronics, sensor controls, towers, foundations, and other components for both land-based and offshore wind projects.</p>
<p>At the end of 2016, the rated capacity of worldwide wind power generation reached&nbsp;481 gigawatts (GW) and U.S. capacity reached&nbsp;83 GW. Effective management of the growing fleet of wind turbines requires asset management tools to monitor, operate, and maintain
 these machines to maximize reliability and power generation and optimize O&amp;M total cost.</p>

<p>Wind farm decommissioning (including dismantling of turbines and towers and site remediation) options and costs may have a significant economic impact at the end of life&nbsp;(EOL) or when purchasing a wind farm from a previous owner.&nbsp; Salvage value of material
 and equipment typically only contribute to a small fraction of the EOL expenses.&nbsp; There are many practical lessons that can be learned from European and Canadian countries that have regulations that require wind farm owners to set aside funding for decommissioning
 activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;a limited&nbsp;number of studies that have analyzed the EOL options and&nbsp;provided cost estimations for the work needed to properly remediate&nbsp;a&nbsp;wind farm site.&nbsp; This work will provide insight and&nbsp;guidance on the necessary activities and costs&nbsp;to properly
 decommission a wind farm site.&nbsp; That information can then be&nbsp;used to help secure those funds during the operational life of the asset.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of 2015, approximately 250 GW<sub>dc</sub> of solar power was installed on a global cumulative basis. Half of this capacity is utility-scale/central station&nbsp;PV plants. This subset of solar PV installations&nbsp;is the primary focus of the Solar project
 set (PS193C). Utility-scale installations have helped reduce solar PV's cost of electricity through reductions in capital expenses (e.g., progress along manufacturing learning curves), operating expenses (e.g., continuous improvement processes and scale economies
 in O&amp;M), and technology innovations (e.g., PV module power increases). Continued advances along these themes are likely to bring solar PV's cost of electricity closer to unsubsidized, cost-competitiveness, further increasing its deployment.</p>
<p>Existing solar PV deployments are serving as informational feedback loops to drive future learning. Record capacity installations are expected to continue globally, with 66 GW<sub>dc</sub> predicted in 2016 and 68 GW<sub>dc</sub> in 2017.&nbsp; It is anticipated
 that cost reductions will happen incrementally through deepening understanding of existing technologies and processes, with the possibility of breakthrough innovations accelerating reductions. Greater understanding of plant performance is needed to better
 predict and optimize lifetime costs against lifetime energy production. As capital expenses continue to decrease, &nbsp;operating expenses become a more important driver of solar’s cost of electricity, both in terms of its expense and maintaining energy output
 at desired or contractually-bound levels. Accurate and predictive knowledge of technology performance and reliability will reduce project risk and/or increase returns on investment. At the system level, it is equally important to have a holistic understanding
 of a solar plant’s life cycle—from its design through to its decommissioning—in order to optimize its lifetime costs against its lifetime energy. Increased industry learning and collaboration is needed to move away from a near-term $/W focus to a longer-term
 lifetime energy versus lifetime costs focus (i.e., levelized cost of electricity).</p>
<p>Work in&nbsp;Project Set 193C&nbsp;is divided into 3 research themes to provide practical understanding and guidance to key industry needs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research and in-depth analysis to better predict, validate, and understand lifetime energy production of solar technologies
</li><li>Gather industry best practices, standards, and costs associated with solar plants, from design to decommissioning
</li><li>Provide objective, unbiased analysis on rapidly changing market, costs, and technology to help inform utility decision making
</li></ul>
<p>These efforts are closely coordinated with and designed to complement work undertaken in other sectors and programs within EPRI, such as Energy Storage and Distributed Generation program (P94), Bulk Power System Integration of Variable Generation (P173),
 Integration of Distributed Energy Resources program (P174), Technology Assessment, Market Analysis, and Generation Planning program (P178), Distribution Systems program (P180), and other project sets within the Renewable Generation (P193) Program.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that the first-time owner of many PV plants will not be its only owner. In the U.S., the Investment Tax Credit and accelerated depreciation schedule have a five year time window to fully extract their benefit (and not be subject to recapture).
 After five years, it may be financially preferable for the original owners to sell the plant and extract cash for other investments. Short-term thinking in upfront $/W terms may create long-term technical and financial ramifications for the second-owner (and
 beyond).</p>

<p>It is widely expected that PV plant capital expenses (e.g., overnight $/W) will continue to decline in the coming years. Module prices continue their downward pricing trajectory and some Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) firms are reducing
 margins to gain market share as PV installations continue to grow year-on-year globally. Meeting these cost reduction targets can come at the sake of quality, which is often overlooked when projects are judged by $/W instead of LCOE. There is a need to better
 quantify the impact of quality along the PV supply chain.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Rising operating costs, increased competition from other generating sources, and regulatory pressures have increased the need to improve plant heat rates. Heat rate improvements bear a direct relationship to tonnage releases of all air emissions, including
 CO<sub>2</sub>. &nbsp;The integration of heat rate assessment capability into retrofits of operating plants and new plant designs is critical to ensuring the optimal efficiency in plant operations.</p>
<p>The focus of the Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Heat Rate Improvement program (Program 194) is to improve operating plant heat rate, independent of the fuel fired. The program will advance the state of the art, benefitting all power generating
 companies -- including those now starting performance improvement programs and those with vast experience and mature programs.</p>
<p>The efforts behind improving heat rate require a broad understanding of power plant design, operation, maintenance, ambient conditions, thermal sciences, combustion, and the type of fuel fired. To be successful, a holistic view must be taken to ensure results
 are both cost-effective and do not create problems elsewhere in the plant. The Heat Rate Improvement program activities include research on thermodynamics, auxiliary power consumption, heat transfer, plant processes, controls, new hardware, fluid dynamics,
 measurement, and software, in addition to issues related to fuel quality and the combustion process.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Heat Rate Improvement program focuses on a holistic approach to cost-effectively enhance power plant efficiency without creating side effects. Heat rate improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yield significant savings in fuel costs and are by far the lowest-cost and a proven and commercially available method for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.&nbsp;
</li><li>Improve overall combined-cycle plant performance, permitting those sites to reduce fuel costs per MW as their capacity factors increase.
</li><li>Can enable program members to achieve substantial cost savings through improved boiler performance, regained capacity, and increased flexibility in fuel sourcing.
</li><li>Can reveal reliability related problems in the quest to identify performance or thermal efficiency problems, permitting timely maintenance and a reduction of generation costs.
</li><li>Enhance operational flexibility by improving plant performance at part and low load.

<p>The program R&amp;D for 2017 will continue to focus on a holistic approach to improve the power plant heat rate independent of the fuel fired. Specific efforts may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Condenser performance advances: This project follows the recent work done on measurements of very low pressures and evaluation of the application of coatings and potential modifications and/or physical changes to enhance heat transfer to improve the condenser’s
 performance. </li><li>Evaluation of CEMS as a measure of heat rate: Following the recent work done by EPRI in this field, this project will conduct additional field evaluations to determine the current accuracies and assess potential modifications to improve the application
 of technologies. </li><li>Evaluation of automated methods to identify sources of boiler air in-leakage: This R&amp;D evaluates the installation of acoustical sensors to detect changes in boiler air in-leakage on a more real-time basis, including air in-leakage in areas with limited
 access. </li><li>Modifications and actions to improve combined-cycle plant heat rate: This project evaluates the potential of successful heat rate improvement activities in coal-fired plants for application in combined-cycle units.
</li><li>Sustainability of heat rate improvements: This R&amp;D estimates the sustainability of common heat rate improvements, determines the degradation rates for those heat rate improvement actions and modifications, and determines costs to maintain the improvement
 or slow the degradation rate. </li><li>Improving startups to reduce costs and optimize heat rate: This multi-year project will identify potential improvements to unit startup activities to optimize heat rate without increasing maintenance costs. Both hardware modifications and new operational
 techniques will be evaluated.&nbsp; </li><li>Improved fluid flow measurements: Methods to measure key flow rates (e.g., attemperation) will be evaluated in an attempt to both improve plant efficiency and minimize the deleterious effects of excessive flow rates.

<p>Steam condenser performance has a large, and often detrimental, effect on power plant heat rate.&nbsp; The steam power cycle, prevalent in all steam power plants, is based on the rejection of low temperature waste heat and the condensing of the steam exhausted
 from the low pressure turbines.&nbsp; Condensers provide that function by passing a large volume of cooling water through thousands of tubes which are placed directly below the steam turbine’s exhaust.&nbsp;&nbsp; Power plant operators and designers have sought to improve
 the heat transfer in the condenser to minimize the adverse effects on plant performance.&nbsp; Their methods have included periodic cleaning of the raw water side of condenser tubes, minimizing the tube wall thickness, and using materials more conducive to heat
 transfer for the tube walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But very little attention has been paid to the steam side of condenser tubes until recently.&nbsp; Placing a very thin coating on the exterior of the tubes to enhance condensation and heat transfer may be an option to improve condenser performance and that of
 the entire power plant.&nbsp; Recently nano-coatings have been developed to potentially make the tube surfaces more hydrophobic, which could improve heat transfer.</p>

<p>Increases in the gas side pressure drop in HRSGs readily translate into performance penalties.&nbsp; The degradation of heat transfer reduces steam production and temperatures, while excessive pressure drops limit gas turbine performance.&nbsp; HRSG internals due
 to their geometry and material of construction combined with impurities in the turbine exhaust gases have experienced increasing pressure drops.&nbsp; Methods to reduce the pressure drop across the HRSG can be explored to improve combined cycle plant performance.</p>

<p>Boiler air inleakage degrades power plant performance. When occurring upstream of a steam generator’s O<sub>2</sub> probes, it can drive the furnace into a super-substoichiometric condition, potentially increasing the damage to internal components, increasing
 unburned carbon, affecting ash sales, limiting NOx reduction levels, and decimating boiler performance. Independent of its location, the unplanned-for increase in flow through the backpass of the unit will push the limits of induced draft fan capabilities
 and, under some circumstances, may eventually cause a unit derate. The excess flow passing through particulate collection devices, such as electrostatic precipitators and baghouses, sharply reduces their collection efficiencies and may increase SO<sub>3</sub>
 levels.</p>

<p>Combined cycle power plants are now operating with higher capacity factors, making heat rate improvements a priority to reduce fuel costs and emissions.&nbsp; EPRI has been on the forefront in identifying different actions and modifications to improve combined
 cycle plant heat rate.&nbsp; Actions to improve heat rate will only occur if cost justified.&nbsp; That justification requires a precise value for the potential heat rate improvement instead of a range or estimate.&nbsp; Hence the industry needs a methodology to determine
 the heat rate improvement value and gains through its demonstration and ultimate application.</p>

<p>A reliable measurement of key power plant flow rates is essential for optimal control, performance monitoring, and performance improvements.&nbsp; Many of the devices used for continuous flow measurement have typically been in service for the life of the plant
 and their actual condition may not be well understood.&nbsp; Several avenues of potential degradation exist, which can affect the accuracy of the flow rate measurement.&nbsp; The nuclear power industry has struggled for decades with feedwater flow measurement challenges,
 specifically the phenomena of Venturi fouling.&nbsp; Higher levels of plant performance and flexible operations are now expected for the existing coal and gas-fired fleets, which will require reliable data.</p>

<p>Caught between the requirements of environmental regulations, low gas prices permitting higher capacity factors of combined cycle units, and the variations due to renewable generation, the operating environment for formerly base-loaded coal plants has become
 more challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp; All types of fossil-fired units are experiencing more startups.&nbsp; In addition to the increased wear and tear on the plant components, those startups come with a substantial cost for fuel, aux power, labor, and other materials.&nbsp; Through the
 evaluation of startup processes, and potential procedural and hardware improvements, unit startups may be optimized leading to the realization of heat rate improvements and cost savings.</p>

<p>In the recent push to improve heat rate many options have been identified.&nbsp; Power plant owners and operators in their quest to balance the competing needs for scarce budget funds must decide which heat rate improvements to pursue and have little guidance
 on the lifetime or sustainability of those heat rate improvement actions.&nbsp; If a company invests millions of dollars into a physical modification, how much or little of the resulting improvement still exist in 2, 5, or even 10 years?&nbsp; And can actions be taken
 to reduce the rate of degradation?</p>

                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Program Description</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) Endangered and Protected Species Program develops forward-looking, in-depth studies of methodologies, ecological/spatial models, regulatory developments, and economic implications at the intersection of species
 and ecosystem protection and electric power generation and delivery as well as other commercial activities. This applies to both existing facilities and operations as well as those being planned for the future.</p>
<p>In the course of generating and delivering power, electric utilities interface with the natural environment in many different ways. For example, utilities often own and/or use large areas of land for power generation and transmission; areas that may include
 critical habitat required for an endangered, candidate, petitioned, or protected species. Utility operations might intersect with species migration routes, nesting or habitat sites, or seasonal behavioral patterns. Utilities might impact fish when withdrawing
 water for cooling operations, or when discharging treated or heated water into waterways or lands that have a delicate ecological balance. Other industries (agriculture, petrochemical, forestry, etc.) have similar interface and impacts to endangered and protected
 species, and are also subject to protection requirements.</p>
<p>This program conducts research applicable to the regulatory landscape both in the U.S and internationally&nbsp;for endangered and protected species, including those related to the following regulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endangered Species Act (ESA): Enacted in 1973, the law was designed to “protect and recover imperiled species and the ecosystems on which they depend.”
</li><li>Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA): Enacted in 1918, the MBTA covers 1,007 native birds - the majority of birds that nest in the United States. The MTBA makes it unlawful to take a migratory bird (or its egg, nest, or any other part of the bird).
</li><li>Bald and Golden Eagle Act (BGEPA): The Act was passed in 1940 to protect the bald eagle and expanded in 1962 to cover golden eagles. BGEPA prohibits take of the eagle or any bird part, egg, or nest (16 U.S.C. §668).
</li><li>Clean Water Act (316(b): Section 316(b) is designed to reduce impingement and entrainment associated with cooling water intake structures (CWIS). The final Rule published in August 2014 has an increased focus on protecting federally listed T&amp;E species with
 procedural requirements for applicants, state water quality permit directors, and federal agencies (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, [FWS]; National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS] and the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]).
</li><li>Other federal and state species regulations: There are state endangered species regulations in all 50 states.
</li><li>International regulatory frameworks,&nbsp;including those of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
</li></ul>
<p>The FWS and the NMFS, referred to as the Services, lead federal decision-making with respect to the regulations cited above, including decisions to list a species as threatened or endangered. Species can be categorized as candidate or petitioned species
 for “listing,” as threatened or endangered under the ESA. If the Services determine that threats to a species warrant protection under the ESA, there are a range of provisions required to comply with the ESA, including: avoidance and minimization of impacts
 to species habitat, compensatory mitigation, conservation planning, monitoring, personnel education, and seasonal restrictions of activities. There are also absolute or partial restrictions on impact, best management practices, or technological requirements
 to comply with other species-related regulation.</p>
<p>Through 2018, there will be many species slated for listing as endangered or threatened under the ESA. Critical habitat designations associated with those listing decisions are also taking place. At the same time, the August 2014 final 316(b) rule created
 a unique review period in which USFWS and NMFS have the opportunity to review potential impacts on federally threatened or endangered species of permit applications for CWIS. Recent developments have also been seen in avian protection, including an expanded
 permit period under the BGEPA for renewable energy projects, and discussion of a permit system for incidental take under the MBTA.&nbsp; All of these regulatory developments have important implications for power companies and other commercial activities (land management,
 project development, operations and maintenance, employee education, permits, and potential risk).</p>
<p>To address these issues, EPRI identified active areas of program research related to ecological, spatial, economic, regulatory, and planning topics. Members, agencies, and the public will have access to this strong foundation of research, which they can
 use to inform decision-making. To address research opportunities in Endangered and Protected Species, EPRI designed a research and development plan that covers the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving decision-making in listing and delisting species; </li><li>Understanding the importance of critical habitat for endangered and protected species;
</li><li>Conservation planning to improve the chances of species population recovery; and
</li><li>Improving collaboration among federal and state agencies, utilities, agricultural operations, and industrial organizations in the area of endangered and protected species.
</li></ul>
<p>By pursuing these novel research areas at this time, EPRI will create a strong body of work and results on endangered species issues.</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Research Value</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>The program delivers high-quality research in a variety of disciplines on topics related to species status and recovery, conservation tools and comparison, economic implications of endangered species regulation, case studies, conceptual design of conservation
 methodologies, and innovative design for implementation and evaluation. EPRI’s multidisciplinary research endeavors to use conservation biology, ecosystem analysis, population dynamics, spatial analysis, and environmental economics, to describe, quantify,
 and contextualize results as they apply to power companies, other commercial activities, and the public.</p>
<p>The research value of critical habitat and conservation planning studies are widely applicable to EPRI members and the general public from a conceptual and a case-study standpoint. The program examines how critical habitat designation regulations affect
 species population in the short and long term, and whether they are effective for species protection. Research from the program will rigorously review options for conservation planning so members and other stakeholders can make informed decisions.</p>
<p>EPRI creates a body of species-specific case studies with respect to listing, critical habitats, and past conservation planning. This allows researchers to draw upon disparate case studies to pinpoint generalizable results applicable to a wide cross-section
 of membership. Additionally, if EPRI has performed research specific to a candidate or petitioned species, the results should provide a strong basis for providing input to a formal public comment period to the Services.</p>
<p>Research on endangered and protected species is important to a range of power and other companies, that have different regional as well as ecological considerations. Participation of a cross-section of members allows lessons learned from different sectors
 to be shared. For example, organizations that have renewable-related issues will be able to collaborate on species and habitat knowledge, and data with organizations with more traditional generation. Membership from outside the traditional utility members
 could provide collaboration across many sectors that impact endangered and protected species and could provide for management options beyond those traditionally considered by a single sector. The technical results of this program are broadly applicable to
 international utilities and stakeholders</p>
</div>
                        
                            <h5 class=""program-overview-section"">Approach</h5>
                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>This EPRI research program provides, for the first time, a systematic, program-level look at how endangered and protected species can be affected by electric utility and other commercial operations. This is a fast-growing area of regulation, and EPRI is
 committed to research and development on a number of important aspects including regulatory, economic, ecological, and spatial analysis, from the case study to the broad impact scale. This program delivers these scientific and economic studies to industry
 and the general public in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the short term, EPRI works to understand immediate data needs for listing delisting, critical habitat protection, and conservation planning actions that can be undertaken in a short time period.
</li><li>The program undertakes research on relevant individual species regarding their interaction with electric power and other commercial operations and allows EPRI to provide public comments on an ad-hoc basis on species proposed for listing.
</li><li>The program builds cooperative efforts with the Services and stakeholder groups on topics such as conservation planning, critical habitat protection, and regulatory drivers.
</li><li>The program evaluates innovative approaches to conservation, collaboration with agencies and civil society stakeholders, and compliance with regulation. EPRI identifies, ranks, and evaluates those approaches with respect to endangered species populations,
 and with the power company objective of reliable generation and delivery of electricity.
</li><li>The program augments EPRI’s existing research on avian, sturgeon, eel, and 316(b) issues, by focusing on new areas including: research specifically relevant to the ESA; species that fall under multiple species regulations; and new options for conservation
 planning. The program includes a long term focus on sustainability, cost-effectiveness, safety, and reliability in power generation and delivery, and a proactive examination of endangered species regulations. The Endangered and Protected Species program provides
 strong scientific and economic analysis for members to use for long-term decision making.

<p>There are many knowledge and data gaps with protected and candidate species, and resources to fill those gaps are limited. Coordination and collaboration among electric power organizations, federal agencies, state agencies, industrial groups and NGOs will
 reduce these knowledge and data gaps, and allow each party to leverage its resources. It is important for the agencies to receive required information in a timely fashion, so that listing and delisting decisions can be made with high quality science-based
 input. In addition, information on the critical habitat associated with single or multiple endangered species used in regulatory listing decisions will be enhanced with additional data. Coordination and collaboration among entities can be enhanced by periodic
 workshops, webcasts, teleconferences and written messages that address key research gaps and present new research results and knowledge exchange. It is important to recognize that within FWS, listing decisions are highly decentralized; hence, it is important
 to coordinate not only with national staff but also regional and field office staff.</p>
<p>The key research driver for this project is to develop methods to promote cooperation among researchers, regulatory and commercial stakeholders, share the best scientific information for high-quality decision-making, and undertake collaborative projects
 to fill knowledge and data gaps.</p>

<p>Agencies take action to protect specific species with low populations, and their associated habitats. These actions are specified in the Endangered Species Act of 1973. A provision of this Act provides for partnerships with non-Federal parties to conserve
 ecosystems where candidate species exist to aid in the recovery of the species. There are many different types of planning strategies to facilitate conservation. These include candidate conservation agreements, candidate conservation agreements with assurances,
 habitat conservation plans, safe harbor agreements, species conservation banks, and voluntary prelisting conservation actions derived from a new policy which is currently under development by the Services. Each of these tools for conservation planning have
 a similar goal of facilitating species survival, but they differ in when they are applicable, their adoption rates, and costs and benefits of implementation. Research is needed to characterize and evaluate the different types of conservation planning that
 can be successfully applied for single and multiple species.</p>

<p>The issue of critical habitats is tied closely to the issue of endangered species. The Endangered Species Act requires the Services to designate critical habitat - a specific area or areas which are essential for protecting each listed threatened and endangered
 species. The Services need to protect critical habitat, and reduce or minimize activities that could negatively affect it. At present, less than half of the endangered and threatened listed species have designated critical habitat. This could make the Services
 vulnerable to lawsuits by environmental groups and subject to settlements that would require them to define a large number of critical habitats in a short period of time. In addition, new listed species also require defined critical habitats.</p>
<p>Data on which to base critical habitat decisions are even sparser than data for making listing decisions. In addition there is no widely accepted methodology for determining critical habitat. Key research needs are data and tools to classify habitats and
 determine critical habitats.</p>

<p>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is implemented by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), commonly referred to as the Services. The Services decide whether a species needs protection as either being endangered
 or threatened. Species being considered are often rare and lacking significant population and habitat data. As a result of a court settlement earlier in the decade, the Services were required to make listing decisions on over two hundred species on the candidate
 list by 2017. Hundreds of more species will require listing decisions over the next decade. In addition to listing decisions, the Services will also be facing decisions to downgrade endangered species to threatened status and to delist species. Protection
 of species, whether as a result of the ESA or other federal and state laws, can result in significant costs to electric power organizations and other industrial and municipal sectors, depending on their potential to impact the species of concern. An electric
 power organization may have to alter the operations of its generation and transmission facilities, as well as alter the location for constructing new facilities. Species of concern may be animal or plant, aquatic or terrestrial. The population and habitat
 of these listed species could be affected by plant operations. Examples of potential impacts are: a plant’s intake or discharge waters on fish and mussels, and a plant’s wind turbine on birds and bats. Hence, listing species could require the facility operators
 to modify activities to stop any negative effect on the species population. If a species is de- or downlisted, the level of regulation decreases, as should associated costs.</p>
<p>Many factors affect whether a species is listed or delisted. A valuable contribution from EPRI is evaluation of current data, outcomes, costs and benefits associated with listing and delisting species. To address these issues above, this project in Listing
 and Delisting Species examines critical issues which focus on both information available for agencies, as well as evaluation of past listing and delisting decisions to give insight for future decision-making. These issues include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>costs of conservation planning or activities to mitigate when species are listed;</p>
</li><li>
<p>benefits and disadvantages of listing and delisting species on facility operations and species populations;</p>
</li><li>
<p>types of information that could support listing and delisting decisions;</p>
</li><li>
<p>life history of relevant species;</p>
</li><li>
<p>spatial extent of important or sensitive species affected by facility operations;</p>
</li><li>
<p>review of past outcomes of listing decisions; and</p>
</li><li>options to mitigate for facility operations affecting listing and delisting decisions

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>Business enterprises are constantly striving to increase productivity and enhance their competitiveness in the global marketplace. In many cases, electrification – i.e., the application of novel, energy-efficient electric technologies as alternatives to
 fossil-fueled or non-energized processes – can boost utility productivity and enhance the quality of service to the enterprise and the customers it serves. Electricity offers inherent advantages of controllability, precision, versatility, efficiency, and environmental
 benefits compared to fossil-fueled alternatives in many applications. A lack of familiarity and experience with emerging technologies, however, impedes many enterprises, particularly small- to medium-sized businesses and civil institutions, from pursuing electrification
 measures that can improve the productivity and efficiency of operations. Such enterprises would benefit from information and support from their electric utility. However, electric utilities themselves face obstacles to serving as effective partners in this
 regard. Identifying and measuring the prime opportunities for electrification in a given service territory can be difficult. Utilities must also reconcile electrification strategies with mandated energy efficiency goals that are usually narrowly defined in
 terms of kilowatt-hour reductions. Moreover, the lack of an analytical framework for quantifying the net benefits of electrification strategies – from the customer, utility and societal perspectives – hinders the development of utility-business partnerships
 to facilitate beneficial electrification. This research program aims to address these gaps by developing and refining analytical tools and a knowledge base of technologies, applications, and markets and facilitating stakeholder networks to help utilities evaluate
 and pursue electrification opportunities.</p>

                            <div class=""rich-text"">
<p>With the knowledge acquired through this research program, members will have access to expertise and information that can help them in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquisition of strategic frameworks to evaluate electrification opportunities in their service territories, and tactical tools to pursue program implementations with business customers.
</li><li>Exposure to the latest electric technologies and their market applications. </li><li>Connection to a network of stakeholders – including other utility members, technology vendors, industry associations, end-use customers, government agencies, national laboratories, and other organizations – to advance electrification standards and metrics.
</li></ul>
<p>Through these avenues, members may position themselves for multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved productivity and competitiveness of end-use customers through advancements in overall energy efficiency, reduced costs, and improved throughput.
</li><li>Reduced on-site emissions at end-use customers’ facilities, which assists compliance with environmental regulations and fosters worker health and safety.
</li><li>Reduced net emissions to benefit society-at-large. </li></ul>

<p>The goal of this project set is to determine the most robust and analytically rigorous method to quantify the value of electrification. As utilities develop internal electrification programs, the results from the analytics and modeling efforts can be used
 to reinforce the importance of electrifications. Ways in which this goal will be accomplished include providing a list of analytical resources best suited for different technologies and applications. This will help utilities to determine the best modeling
 resource to use depending upon their specific needs.</p>
<p>Additional tasks will aim to improve the electrification impacts assessment model. The current model will be modified to improve the robustness of the current per unit technology impacts by evaluating these on a rolling basis (e.g. examing payback for an
 electrification technology installed in year 10 vs. year 1 will be different due to changing electricity and fuel escalation rates. Further improvements will include restructuring the analysis tool to better assess multiple technologies with different rate
 structures, enhance data presentation with additional charts, graphs, and tables, and the implementation of more robust sensitivity analysis into the impacts assessment model. All of these improvements will help to further display the value of utility run
 electrification programs.</p>

<p>When business customers are faced with a question of choosing the right technology either to improve their productivity or quality, or to reduce emissions to meet environmental regulations, they often look to utilities as a trusted advisor to help make the
 right decision. Many times utilities have limitations on resources to be able to help these customers. This project seeks to provide that resource to the utility in the form of a Web-based “Electrification Knowledgebase” whereby utilities could quickly pull
 and provide relevant information about new technologies to their customers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, this project set’s technology assessment helps project participants identify the performance characteristics of emerging technologies and ensure the technology not only performs well in the laboratory but works in the field. Members are given
 the tools to handle their customer queries and help them to be viable and competitive.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the decision support tools that can facilitate technology selection and help utilities screen and select the most appropriate electrification applications to help C&amp;I customers implement in their service territories?
</li><li>What is the prerequisite analysis for demonstrating and deploying electrification solutions as part of &nbsp;specific applications with industrial customers?

<p>Expanding electrification technologies can be very difficult.&nbsp; Engaging customers and vendors, and educating external stakeholders in the value of Electrificaiton can be especially challenging.&nbsp; Can utlites, customers, and external stakeholders work together
 to break down communication and institutional barriers that impede the adoption of electrification and it’s subsequent benefits?</p>
<p>This project set is aimed at two key aspects of utility engagement, namely, electrification stakeholder networking and technology transfer. These two aspects are critical to the successful deployment of electric technologies in the participanting utility
 members service territory.</p>
<p>Within this project set, electrification working councils are aimed at providing a transparent communication platform for utilities, vendors, acadamics, regulators and other stakeholders to engage and interact. These working councils also leverage the lessons
 learned and best practices from EPRI’s other working councils such as Infrastructure working council (IWC) in the Electric Transportation program. The electrification working council shall provide an efficient way to exchange market information, technology
 information and finding a common solution to industry problems and barriers to technology deployment.</p>
<p>This project set also seeks to develop training modules aimed at providing an easy method of technology transfer to non-technical business professionals such as utiliy account executives. The knowledge gained through varous projects in the electrification
 program can be effectively utilized by all the participating members as well as their customers through these training modules. The training modules could be vignettes, short videos, fact sheets, and many other forms of technology transfer. The training modules
 shall be a valuable resource for utility personnel. There may be some public facing training modules on technologies that can help utilities to create awareness and reduce customer’s misconceptions of electrification technologies.&nbsp;</p>

 Vision (REV). Other reasons are driven by changes in customer behaviors (low load growth), customer adoption of distributed energy resources (DER), prosumers, as well as recent technological advancements newly available distribution planners and operators.
 Tools and methods for planning and operating the distribution system were not designed to meet this changing landscape.</p>
<p>Distribution systems have been designed for one purpose: reliably serve all customers in a safe and cost effective manner. However in this new era additional objectives must be considered as well, including accommodating high levels of DER, increasing resiliency,
 improving operational efficiency, and actively using distribution systems to provide bulk system services. Traditional planning methods utilizing rules-of-thumb are no longer sufficient and methods and tools for truly optimizing distribution planning and operational
 functions is necessary.</p>
<p>Tools and technologies, such as distribution management systems, automation systems, protection systems, and planning tools must adapt to facilitate the needs of this new distribution system. New technologies and their integration will be critical to allow
 distribution planners and operators to meet these goals and realize this concept of an “Integrated Grid.&quot;&nbsp; This creates certain challenges as some of these needs are current and immediate. As such, a more focused effort in the form of a dedicated EPRI program
 that is focused on assisting utilities in both the near-term and long-term research needs is required.</p>
<p>EPRI's Distribution Operations and Planning Program (P200) has been structured to provide members with research and application knowledge to support planning and management of today’s grid as well as tomorrow’s. The Program includes research that supports
 grid modernization and provides tools for planners, operators, and analysis experts of the modern distribution system. This program will serve as the hub for all activities related to distribution planning and operations.</p>
<p>Members of the Program gain access to a portfolio of projects that cover the range of distribution issues, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with other members and EPRI technical experts to share ideas and solutions, improve knowledge transfer, and
 ultimately improve safety, reliability, and operational performance.</p>

<p>Although EPRI's Distribution Operations and Planning Program is newly founded in 2017, the foundation for this new program was formed out of efforts within the Distribution Systems Program (P180). Prior research and findings from this effort has given valuable
 information that has helped its members and the industry in numerous ways: The following products highlight recent results from these efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution Modeling Guidelines: Recommendations for System and Asset Modeling for Distributed Energy Resource Assessments (3002006115):</strong> This product provides guidance on the distribution system modeling elements that are critical to the
 future of distribution planning with DER. Each component is discussed separately, providing insight into scope, gap issues, value, challenges, approach, and requirements. In addition, each element is prioritized based upon relative importance and urgency.
 Through effective modeling of the distribution system a broad range of benefits can be realized from improved confidence in decision making to increased efficiency of DER impact assessments, visibility into the distribution system, and better utilization of
 existing assets.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Protecting the Modern Distribution Grid: Short-Circuit and Open-Circuit Inverter Test Results (3002006116):</strong> This product characterizes how to model photovoltaic inverters in system impact studies, particularly using EPRI’s OpenDSS simulator.
 This research also characterizes overvoltages and fault current contributions from inverters, by adding to the database of inverters that have been tested. This research presents open-circuit and short-circuit tests on four different single-phase inverters
 in a low-voltage lab with sag generator. It also outlines the plans for additional testing and model development during 2016.</p>
</li><li>

<p>This project set focuses on modern tools for planning and designing distribution systems, new analysis methods and modeling approaches, and incorporation of distributed energy resources (DER) and advanced distribution controls into the planning process.&nbsp;
 The planning, design, and protection of electric distribution systems are undergoing dramatic changes.&nbsp; In the past, distribution planning applied “fit and forget” approaches to design the system such that acceptable electrical conditions are maintained during
 peak load. With the growing penetration of DER (including highly variable renewable generation resources and emerging customer participations), utilities need to analyze and plan for dynamic and complex operating conditions that can occur at any time throughout
 the year. Key research issues involve evaluating modeling requirements and approaches for the design of distribution systems that take into account these advanced functions.</p>
<p>Advanced control schemes that can automatically reconfigure electric distribution feeders as well as high penetrations of DER have added complexities to distribution protection practices.&nbsp; For example, fault current contributions from multiple generation
 devices at multiple locations on the feeder may alter the time coordination of distribution protection devices that &quot;see&quot; different fault current levels. Furthermore, feeder reconfiguration by advanced control schemes such as fault location, isolation, and
 service restoration (FLISR) and optimal network reconfiguration may extend the required reach of a protective device beyond its normal settings.&nbsp; For these reasons and others, the modern distribution grid may need &quot;adaptive&quot; protection schemes that automatically
 switch to the most appropriate setting group based on current system conditions.</p>
<p>The work being done in this project set is closely coordinated with and designed to complement the work being done in the Integration of Distributed Energy Resources (P174), Distribution Systems (P180), Bulk System Planning (P40), Energy Storage and Distributed
 Generation (P94), Information and Communication Technology (P161), Energy Efficiency and Demand Response (P170), and Technology Assessment, Market Analysis, and Generation Planning (P178).</p>

<p>The degree of change currently occurring at the distribution level is without precedent. Distributed energy resources (DER) integration, new forms of customer participation, and other DER are not only altering the nature of system power flows but also shifting
 focus further out to the edges of the system and introducing new forms of uncertainty. New technologies and advanced distribution automation and controls offer a wide range of potential benefits to the system but also increase system complexity and introduce
 new system design challenges. Similarly, more widespread monitoring and metering is providing new levels of system visibility and understanding as well as unlocking potential new operations.</p>
<p>These changes, and their impact to the system, are not accounted for when applying traditional distribution planning tools and methods – which were developed to meet the needs of a more passive distribution system. Consequently, modern planning methods,
 tools, and models are needed to respond to evolving system characteristics and expanding objectives in order to provide planners the means to ensure that current and future distribution system designs will remain safe, reliable, and cost-effective. Additionally,
 improved assessment and evaluation tools will provide a better understanding of new system behaviors, enable more informed investment decisions, and facilitate widespread adoption and integration of new technologies and resources.</p>

<p>Utilities have been, and will continue to invest millions of dollars in the field of switching equipment, communications infrastructure, information technology, and human resources to plan, design, install, commission, operate and maintain Distribution Automation
 solutions that incorporate some method of automated restoration.&nbsp; These systems are deployed with many objective functions, most notably the desire to minimize sustained customer interruptions and outage hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a tremendous number of key design and operational decisions that are involved with a successful deployment, and the electric distribution system is becoming ever more complex.&nbsp; This equates to a significant need in the industry to innovate, evaluate,
 and demonstrate solutions to meet these challenges, while optimizing the benefits achieved for every dollar invested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initiated in 2016, this new project will encompass a wide range of studies and research to determine the most effective approaches to a number of operational decisions.&nbsp; Existing decisions may be based on historical norms for a particular utility, regulatory
 requirements or pressures, local customer expectations or some other combination of factors.&nbsp; These decisions may impact customer reliability metrics, operational and maintenance costs, or other measureable results.&nbsp; This research will expose the key contributing
 factors that lead to different approaches, enabling utilities to evaluate the benefits of changing from their existing operational practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impacts of the changing distribution utility landscape, including the challenges associated with distributed energy resources, net zero customers and the integrated grid will be factored into this research.&nbsp;</p>
